                      "Love" at first sight appears as an obvious concept, but
                      in reality it has undergone radical changes over time and
                      differs depending on the cultural context. This course
                      explores representations of love, longing, and desire in
                      modern Japanese culture and literature. Following a brief
                      excursion to pre-modern understandings of love and tracing
                      its translation into a modern, westernized notion, we ask
                      how love has been conceptualized in relation to sexuality,
                      gender, marriage, and the modern nation state. In
                      particular, we will discuss the (literary) representation
                      of themes such as romantic love, postwar pure love,
                      homosexual love, prostitution, love suicide, parental
                      love, and more.

                      This course will explore transnational Japanese
                      literature, particularly reconsidering the fixed notion of
                      nation-state in relation to literature. In particular, the
                      course will focus on the 20th century historical context
                      of the Japan-US relationship, and will examine
                      broadly-defined literature written by people who moved
                      back and forth between the two countries. Throughout the
                      course, we will critically examine the notion of
                      "Japanese", exploring the ways in which people's movement,
                      imperialism, war, language etc., affected their lives and
                      writings.

                      This course is designed to engage students with vital
                      research perspectives in Film Studies on theory, method
                      and analysis. Building upon the study of a wide range of
                      global films produced at different times, we would
                      navigate the students through several crucial strands of
                      film theories and cultivate their ability in critically
                      approaching the style, aesthetics, and politics of a film
                      work. Theoretical toolkits that we would explore include
                      but are not limited to mise-en-scene, thematic and auteur
                      criticism, genre, psychoanalysis, gender studies, new
                      media theory and so forth.

                      By figuratively dividing the film history in Asia into two
                      stages, namely the pre and post World War II periods, we
                      shall start our two-part survey on Asian film history with
                      this particular course, in which the highlight is directed
                      to early cinemas from East Asia. In positioning the survey
                      of films within the socio-historical exigencies and
                      cultural context of Japan, China (Taiwan &amp; Hong Kong)
                      and Korea before and during World War II, this course
                      offers the students an opportunity to engage with the
                      early cinemas and their evolvement from the perspective of
                      social history and discourses of modernities in this
                      region. Students are expected to acquire the basic
                      knowledge on early cinemas in Asia, and learn to analyze
                      films in relation to certain socio-cultural issues that
                      became significant during the timeframe under examination.

                      and sexuality issues within a wide range of modern and
                      contemporary literary texts. We will also consider how
                      gender plays an important role when it comes to the
                      production and reception of literature in different
                      historic and social contexts. The course will cover the
                      gendering of representational modes, reading practices,
                      writing and genre conventions, and much more.

                      In this fast-changing, ever globalizing world, the life
                      and existence of human beings are to a great extent
                      defined by the urban condition they are enmeshed within
                      and struggling with. This seminar attempts to survey major
                      urban issues and cultural topics in modern societies by
                      engaging with a wide spectrum of cultural texts drawn from
                      films and related media texts; in case studies, particular
                      attention is paid to the social context and cities in
                      Asia. Through the seminar, students will learn to approach
                      and critique the cultural space of cities by utilising key
                      concepts drawn from various theoretical perspectives such
                      as cultural studies, visual culture and sociology.

                      This theory-intensive seminar seeks to explore and reflect
                      upon cinematic image's (im)possibility in representing
                      memory, desire and reality in contemporary times.
                      Following a one-month theory building session based on
                      group reading/discussion of works by philosophers and art
                      historians such as Michel Foucault, Georges Didi-Huberman
                      and Jacques Ranciere, we dedicate the remaining part of
                      the seminar to the critical analysis of a group of
                      contemporary films by global filmmakers, most of which are
                      documentaries. Through this unusual journey, not only do
                      we reconsider how would cinema and image engage political
                      movements and subjects that have been either significant
                      to or suppressed in modern history. Also, we hope that the
                      exploration of both political images and of the politics
                      of image would illuminate our continuing debate in the
                      field of film studies and visual culture.

                      Food is fundamental. It has unparalleled social, economic,
                      and political significance, and is a key marker of power
                      and identity. According to eminent British food historian
                      Ben Rogers, "after language, food is the most important
                      bearer of national identity." Food often serves as a
                      symbol of the primordial self, of "our land," and "our
                      history," and some of the most important national-cultural
                      divisions of humankind are intimately related to diet.
                      Food, as one commentator observed, "is not just relevant,
                      but critical to dozens of disciplines. It's agriculture;
                      it's business; it's health; it's the economy; it's the
                      environment; it's international relations; it's war and
                      peace."

                      behind them. It will provide you with the insight of how
                      you should obtain data, analyze them, and derive

                      Education problems in a society are often perceived as a
                      political or government decision based problem. But if we
                      see the reality in many countries, some of those problems
                      are actually cultural based. As a Well-being program
                      course, this anthropology of education course aims to
                      equip students (participants) with greater understanding
                      of education problems and culture so as to create
                      wellbeing in Asia from the perspective of women leaders.
                      Students learn some important concepts related to cultural
                      issues (religion, philosophy, manner, oral culture, etc.)
                      in educational problems with reference to real problems
                      happening in the South East Asia region.

                      The aim of education processes is a basic problem, which
                      should be discussed before other themes. Sometimes,
                      however, this theme is skipped and discussion on education
                      will flow to themes such as curriculum, education content,
                      pedagogic, skill etc. Does education in every nation have
                      the same aim? As a Well-being program course, this seminar
                      on philosophy of human becoming course aims to equip
                      students (participants) with greater understanding of the
                      aims of education process in societies, with special
                      reference to South East Asia. The goal of the course is to
                      have participants understand the varieties of human
                      becoming processes and its objective as the goal of
                      education in societies.

                      Wellbeing is one of the main aims in life for people in
                      modern society. However, the science of well-being and
                      happiness is a relatively new branch of Psychology. This
                      course offers a scientific exploration of the topic
                      through the lenses of Social and Positive Psychology,
                      exploring the key issues with cross-cultural references.
                      The class focuses on the psychological aspects of a
                      fulfilling and flourishing life with special emphasis on
                      the wellbeing of women.

                      then discuss what content and method would be most

                      In the human development process, the problem of a
                      society's values and how they induct other members into
                      through education should be an issue of concern since it
                      could interfere with people's wellbeing. If anthropologist
                      are trying to look at what really happened in a society
                      (what is the purpose of education but to build a
                      society?), to know how people recognise their own problems
                      and explain them logically is important. By knowing how a
                      society identifies problems related to education
                      (theoretically), we can know the relation between ideology
                      and views in the society and how the same ideology is
                      applied within that society.

                      This course examines various styles and methods used in
                      academic writing within the Social Sciences. It introduces
                      students to the idea of clarity and consistency in
                      writing. The course is open to all graduate students in
                      law school who are interested in the topic; however, it is
                      aimed primarily at the introductory level of academic
                      work. The course is designed to supplement and enhance
                      Academic Writing courses I &amp; III and will include a
                      review of the grammar and structural issues that often
                      plague students at this level as well as provide lessons
                      on developing organized paragraphs. At present, no text is
                      offered although there will be required supplementary
                      lessons accessed through My Writing Lab. Students are
                      advised to become familiar with the required departmental
                      writing guidelines for their theses available on the GSL
                      web-site.

                      This workshop fully acknowledges the ever increasing need
                      for comparison in a world in which pluralistic and
                      transnational features are commonplace. In addressing the
                      'comparative study of law', it covers broad fields
                      comprising different scholarly orientations and inside
                      debates. However, rather than focusing on knowledge about
                      comparative law as a separate academic field of legal
                      science in the law curriculum, this workshop provides
                      students with the opportunity to actually engage in
                      comparative legal studies. First, they will gain a
                      critical appreciation of the need to undertake the complex
                      task of studying law comparatively. Second, they will
                      learn how to handle a wide range of transborder issues
                      through various comparative research strategies, practices
                      and techniques from a comparative perspective. Focusing
                      more precisely on questions relating to cross-border legal
                      institution design, this workshop deals with the many
                      processes involved in contemporary legal borrowings, and
                      questions the pertinence from a practical perspective of
                      concepts (including 'legal transplants') generally used by
                      comparatists to explain the 'transfrontier mobility of the
                      law'.

                      This course builds on the knowledge acquired in political
                      science for undergraduates, and focuses on the comparative
                      perspective and critical thinking skills required to make
                      policies. Regular reading assignments will be issued and
                      class members will take an active role in discussing the
                      issues. Prof. Westra will also provide supplementary
                      sessions on international political economics to enable
                      students to understand the context of contemporary
                      domestic politics. A short final essay will test basic
                      knowledge and skills acquired during the course, but our
                      most important work will be done in class discussions.

                      In 1947, the Judicial Constitution Act and the
                      Administrative Court Act were repealed. This marked a new
                      beginning for the new court system. More than 60 years
                      have since passed during which time the system of judicial
                      review of administrative action has developed. However,
                      the contemporary situation raises many problems for us for
                      which we need urgent reform. Through this lecture,

                      This course aims to explore some characteristic regimes of
                      company law from a comparative perspective. Each class
                      deals with specific topics related to company law,
                      inspired by theoretical and practical discussions about
                      German, UK and US company law carried out in a comparative
                      manner. Depending on students' interests and enthusiasm,
                      the comparison can extend to counterparts in Japanese or
                      other students' home countries.

                      What is the most difficult aspect of setting up a legal
                      system? Legislation, funding, or the provision of
                      facilities? Each of these stages does have its own
                      problems, but it is believed that training of personnel
                      presents the biggest hurdle. Technical, legal and moral
                      competence is required for those who staff and run the
                      legal system. How can legal education provide such
                      qualities to its trainees? Discussion and interviews are
                      conducted following intensive reading on the subject.

                      This seminar will combine the theory of legal and business
                      ethics with the practicalities of developing nations.
                      Students will wrestle with questions such as how one can
                      be ethical when working in a system containing corruption.
                      The course, on the one hand, will draw upon theory of
                      liberal democracy and the constitutional state. On the
                      other, it will ask students to address scenarios testing
                      their practical knowledge and rectitude. Practitioners and
                      experts will participate as necessary. The course will be
                      taught in English. Students will give oral presentations
                      of assigned topics during the course. A short research
                      paper is also required as the final essay. International
                      and Japanese students are invited to attend.

                      It has been six years since Uzbek government forces killed
                      hundreds of unarmed protesters in the eastern city of
                      Andijan on May 13, 2005, following prison attacks by armed
                      men. Divergent views persist today with regard to this
                      Andijan tragedy in the context of human rights and
                      democracy.{" "}
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The position taken by the Uzbek government, supported by
                      Russia, China and countries in Central Asia, places the
                      blame on the terrorists. It claims that the armed group
                      belonged to the terrorists group known as Akramia - a
                      faction of the illegal Hizb-ut-Tahri (an Islam
                      fundamentalist Party), which sought to establish an
                      Islamic State refusing to accept human rights and
                      democracy. They attacked the prison and used citizens as
                      human shields while attempting to withdraw. That was how
                      the gun battle started and they should be held responsible
                      for the subsequent deaths. Uzbekistan has no choice but to
                      respond to "violence" by the Islamic fundamentalists, who
                      reject human rights and democracy, with equal violence.
                      The argument states that, for a premature secular state
                      that had gained independence for a mere 20 years, any
                      response to violence by means of respect for human rights
                      and democracy would lead to the demise of the State and
                      therefore the end of human rights and democracy. (Cry like
                      a wolf when living with the wolf).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      In light of this first view, certain Western countries and
                      international human rights NGOs come up with their
                      critical arguments that human rights were violated in
                      Uzbekistan under the pretext of fighting terrorism led by
                      the Islamic fundamentalists. Even a young 20-year-old
                      independent State has a duty to respect human rights and
                      democracy. Notwithstanding the future goal of human rights
                      and democracy, violence carried out in response to
                      violence will create a vicious circle of violence and
                      hatred and render the future goal unachievable.

                      Six years after the Andijan tragedy, this criticism of
                      Uzbekistan has not changed. For example, the Human Rights
                      Watch included the following wording in its 2012 World
                      Report: Uzbekistan's human rights record remains
                      appalling, with no meaningful improvements in 2011.
                      Torture remains endemic in the criminal justice system.
                      Authorities continue to target civil society activists,
                      opposition members, and journalists, and to persecute
                      religious believers who worship outside strict state
                      controls. What should be an appropriate way for
                      Uzbekistan, a State still in the building process and the
                      front line of the war against terror, to develop its own
                      goals of human rights and democracy? How should legal
                      assistance proceed to promote the development of human
                      rights and democracy in this country? This paper reviews
                      some lessons learned from JICA's experience of legal
                      assistance (assistance in drafting the law on
                      administrative procedures) in Uzbekistan and raises some
                      issues that may be useful for the development of
                      comparative studies in administrative law.

                      The purpose of this course is to explore the main
                      methodological traditions and their practical implications
                      in comparing different legal institutions in a globalized
                      world. The first session (lectures 1-3) will consist of a
                      theoretical inquiry into traditional, as well as
                      innovative, comparative law methods. We will study how to
                      compare and apply these methods to the most controversial
                      topics existing within the current legal debate. In the
                      second session (lectures 4-6), we will turn our attention
                      to globalization, an area in which comparative law is
                      essential for understanding many contemporary relevant
                      phenomena.

                      International protection of human rights has largely
                      developed under the auspices of the United Nations. In
                      particular, international law in the field of human rights
                      has contributed greatly to such developments. The first
                      part of this course is designed to provide students with
                      general knowledge of international human rights law, and,
                      based on such perspectives, the second part will focus on
                      rather specific problems/situations around the world. (The
                      "international human rights law" mentioned above includes,
                      for example, the International Covenant on Civil and
                      Political Rights, and on Economic, Social and Cultural
                      Rights, the Convention of the Rights of Child, etc.) The
                      discussion of the course will evolve around the following
                      questions:{" "}
                      <ol>
                        <li>
                          What principles should form the foundations of
                          international human rights laws?

                        <li>
                          Under what conditions can an international law system
                          contribute to the realization of universal protection
                          of human rights?

                      This is an introductory course aimed at those who want to
                      study international law, with the aim of imparting what
                      international law is and how it functions. Due to time
                      constraints, it does not cover the entire field of
                      international law. However, through the analysis of the
                      ICJ judgment in the Nicaragua case, it will give you a
                      basic idea of international law. Emphasis will be placed
                      on the structural change of international law between
                      traditional and contemporary international law.

                      It would appear that overseas students entering the LL.M.
                      in Comparative Law Program (English-taught program) arrive
                      knowing very little about Japan. However, while this
                      course curriculum presents advanced theories of law in
                      each of its lecture series, there is a lack of explanation
                      for those new to Japanese law and society. Therefore, to
                      provide overseas students with some general information
                      regarding Japan, this course is run in conjunction with
                      the Aichi Prefectural Bar Association (International
                      Special Committee) and the teaching staff of Nagoya
                      University. Lectures are given in conjunction with onsite
                      visits (around half the time for each. Several lectures
                      are presented). The lectures consist of prior study of
                      relevant materials, pre-visit explanations, question and
                      answer sessions based on the visits, and a comparison of
                      the system in Japan with that in students' country so as
                      to further students' understanding of the law and society
                      in their own countries. It is important that the onsite
                      visits become the core part of the lectures so as to
                      enhance students' knowledge of Japanese society and law.
                      As a result of this varied learning experience, students
                      will make comparisons with their own countries' systems
                      and societies, and submit reports on future perspectives
                      they see developing for their own countries. Over the
                      course of a half year of lectures, students will be given
                      a vivid impression of the overall shape of Japanese
                      society and legal system.

                      The transformation that took place in Japan during the
                      period of the Allied occupation (1945-1952) is generally
                      regarded as a successful case of
                      institution-transplantation under international control
                      coupled with democratization. This example is considered a
                      good stepping stone for a study of "cross-border legal
                      institution transplantation". This lecture focuses on the
                      process of crafting the Constitution of Japan (promulgated
                      in 1946, entered into force in 1947), picking up and
                      examining the representative legal theories supporting
                      this transformation.

                      skills relevant to international business transactions.
                      The course will be divided into two parts. In a series of
                      practical exercises, class members will be divided into
                      teams, and attempt to negotiate on the basis of the facts
                      presented in the exercise materials. In most class
                      sessions, half of class time will be assigned to
                      negotiation exercises, and half to discussion of the
                      outcome.

                      Course Design: This course is composed of three subjects.
                      The coursework of each subject will build on the last,
                      which means that each subject must be undertaken in the
                      appropriate order and successfully completed. Thus, Peer
                      Support Initiative 1 (PSI 1) must be completed before
                      moving onto PSI 2 and then PSI 3, which centers on
                      overseas training. It is not possible to skip any of these
                      subjects. About PSI-1 focuses on providing new
                      international students with information on Japan's
                      culture, society, laws and politics, as well as helping
                      these students to adjust their new environment. Japanese
                      students will gain an understanding of the laws, politics
                      and society of their respective international student
                      group members and explain Japanese law, politics and
                      society in a comparative way.

                      PSI-2 (Peer Support Initiative 2) prioritizes the law and
                      politics of the international students' home countries,
                      with the aim of deepening mutual understanding of the
                      participants' countries. To enable the characteristics of
                      the international students' home countries' legal and
                      political systems to be better highlighted, Japanese
                      students shall, when needed, provide information on Japan.
                      As far as possible, the international students will
                      explain the law and society of their own country in
                      Japanese. Opportunities for Japanese students to give the
                      same explanations in the languages of international
                      students will be increased. Documents containing these
                      explanations will be created by Japanese and international
                      students in cooperation with each other. Video
                      conferencing, multilingual group bulletin boards and so on
                      will be actively used, and collaborative learning will
                      take place in a variety of fields, not just in students'
                      specialist areas. The video conferencing system will be
                      useful for training within informal discussions. Small
                      group trips to investigate the courts and other judicial
                      institutions in Japan will be encouraged and students will
                      receive assistance to independently gather materials for
                      Japanese students' research of these places.

                      The purpose of this final phase is to bring together the
                      work carried out in the prior two semesters and to conduct
                      detailed field research. In this portion of the program,
                      students will conduct field research in their target
                      countries, complete a report detailing their research, and
                      present their research results. The field trip portion is
                      not required for foreign students though they are
                      encouraged to attend if possible. Foreign students are
                      however responsible for working with their Japanese team

                      In the first three classes, the instructor (Suzuki) will
                      give lectures. The students are supposed to study the
                      materials (distributed in advance) and prepare for the
                      discussion in the class. The remaining classes will be
                      conducted as seminars. Namely, assigned student(s) will
                      give presentations first, and then all the participants
                      join discussions which will be moderated by the assigned
                      student(s) with assistance from the instructor. In these
                      seminars, all the participants are expected to read
                      assignments (academic articles and/or court decisions with
                      comments) beforehand and contribute actively to the

                      The purpose of this course is to allow students to develop
                      the skills needed to understand foreign legal systems and
                      search for better ways of building appropriate legal
                      systems for different communities using comparative
                      techniques. This series of lectures focuses mainly on East
                      and South Asia. Because Asia is a vast region that
                      contains a multitude of cultural backgrounds, we do not
                      have a clear definition of the term "Asian law". Only a
                      small number of universities in the world provide courses
                      on "Asian law" at either the undergraduate or graduate
                      level. The term is often used to refer simply to Chinese
                      law, even in Asia, or Indian law as it is in the United
                      Kingdom. In this course, we use East Asia in order to gain
                      a clearer understanding of contemporary Japanese law, and
                      South Asia to gain a better understanding of the actual
                      situation surrounding the application of religious laws.
                      During the course of these lectures we will learn how to
                      locate appropriate sources, a skill that is essential in
                      finding the applicable law and resolving legal problems.
                      An example of this would be finding the conditions
                      necessary for a valid marriage in the case of a mixed
                      marriage.

                      macroeconomics. After briefly summarizing the theory for
                      each topic, the course focuses on understanding the major
                      empirical evidence in the macroeconomy and will provide
                      insight into macroeconomics for those interested in the
                      practical analysis of macroeconomy. We will develop tools
                      for understanding (or ability to apply the theory to)
                      current topics in macroeconomics by analyzing economic
                      models and examining actual data. Students are expected to
                      make a presentation of each empirical paper and to
                      participate in class discussions.

                      economy through studying theories of economic development
                      and case studies of China's economic development. China
                      became the world's second largest economy beyond Japan in

                      United States as No.1 in 2018 by PPP according to a
                      prediction of OECD. Currently China is transforming itself
                      from a "factory of the world" into the main "market of the
                      world". What are the secrets of China high growth? What
                      are the problems facing China now? Can China continue its
                      high growth? How should the world deal with a rising
                      China? This lecture will provide you some optional answers
                      to the above questions.

                      In macroeconomics, subjects of the analysis are the
                      economic activities in a whole country. Thus, learning the
                      macroeconomic theory, we can understand various issues
                      faced by the country. The objective of this course is to
                      learn an applicable ability of the basic macroeconomic
                      theory and an insight into the economy with the
                      perspective of macroeconomics.

                      by studying the following topics: First, we will review
                      foundations of macroeconomics and mathematics. Second,
                      students should understand the Solow model, which is a
                      basic model of economic growth theory. Finally,
                      participants are expected to explain the essential
                      concepts of the overlapping generations model, which is
                      one dynamic macroeconomic model with microfoundations.

                      In this lecture, students will learn theoretical concepts
                      that determine structures and reaction pathways of
                      chemical compounds without using complicated mathematics.
                      For this purpose, students will learn basic concepts of
                      group theory in the first half of this course. Students
                      will learn various point groups, structures of character
                      tables, and basic mathematical techniques related to group
                      theory. Then the students will learn first- and
                      second-order Jahn-Teller effects that are related to the
                      distortions of ground-state structures and the activation
                      energy of chemical reactions. Finally, the students will
                      learn symmetry rules that determine the pathways of
                      reactions.

                      Cosmic rays are particles with the highest energy from the
                      Universe. We can now understand most of the energetic
                      phenomena in the universe by observing cosmic rays.
                      Therefore several kinds of energetic astrophysical objects
                      are shown at first. Multiwavelength observations are also
                      introduced together with cosmic rays in order for students
                      to develop wide astrophysical views. Specific topics in
                      cosmic rays, such as gamma ray astronomy, gamma ray
                      bursts, and most energetic cosmic rays, are also
                      discussed.

                      One way to know the origin and acceleration mechanism of
                      cosmic rays is by observing neutral particles which are
                      produced at the acceleration sites of cosmic rays. In
                      contrast to charged particles, which occupy the main
                      portion of cosmic rays, neutral particles are not
                      reflected by magnetic fields in space. Therefore, we can
                      obtain information about the place and time of the
                      acceleration by observing neutral particles. Among the
                      neutral particles, neutrons associated with solar flares
                      will be the main focus for this lecture.

                      This seminar is designed in a typical journalist club
                      style for students. Every student provides a short
                      presentation about one of the recent topics on cosmic ray
                      physics, astrophysics, particle physics and
                      solar-terrestrial physics. The topics should be selected
                      from very recent journal papers or similar publications.
                      In this way students will develop the skills to search,
                      digest and make a presentation on various works. The
                      students will also learn about recent activities in
                      related research fields and key technologies. Reports are
                      shared among all the CR-lab members. Students who take
                      this seminar must actively join the discussions, and

                      In order to understand the Earth's ionosphere, we study
                      the plasma motion and electric currents in the ionosphere
                      where the plasma collides with the neutral particles.
                      Basic physics of various phenomena in the ionosphere, such
                      as plasma fountain, equatorial anomaly, plasma bubble,
                      traveling ionospheric disturbance, sporadic E, dynamo
                      mechanism and so on, are studied. Radio wave propagation
                      in the ionosphere and ionospheric measurements using radio
                      and optical techniques, especially radar, GPS and airglow
                      CCD imager, are also studied.

                      Learn on the basic knowledge of particle physics from the
                      experimental viewpoint. Especially, understand the
                      overview of the Standard Model of the current particle
                      physics. Furthermore, discuss the issues on the Standard
                      Model and direction of future experiments. The most
                      important purpose is to discuss the physics among the
                      students actively. Discuss the following items among the
                      students, based on the reference textbooks, and in some
                      cases, discuss the current studies, which students
                      actually work on.

                      focus on the lower thermosphere, the upper mesosphere, and
                      the ionosphere. To understand the upper atmosphere more
                      deeply, we also study the lower and middle atmosphere
                      briefly. In particular, we study what makes the atmosphere
                      in motion, interplay between the thermosphere (neutral
                      atmosphere) and ionosphere (ion and electron) and
                      atmospheric waves (gravity waves, tidal waves, and

                      Biostatistics provides us with tools to describe and
                      summarize phenomena observed in populations. The basic
                      approaches of biostatistics include significance testing
                      and inference. This course will explain how to
                      successfully apply both approaches for epidemiologic
                      measurements. In addition, we will cover survival analysis

                      multiplex kit with multi-colored fluorescently labeled
                      primer sets for personal identification. The PCR products

                      produced by epithelial cells lining distal pancreatic
                      ducts. Interlobular ducts isolated from rodent pancreas
                      (diameter: ~100 ¬µm) retain the polarity and function of
                      epithelia and provides a useful tool to investigate
                      cellular and molecular mechanisms of vectorial HCO3-

                      briefly explained and specific laws relating to medical
                      administration and practices in Japan will also be
                      discussed. The application of bioethics in health services

                      We try to clarify the molecular pathology of how virus
                      infections lead to disorders. We also develop novel
                      methods of diagnosis, prevention, and treatment for such
                      virus infections. Our goal is not confined to basic
                      virology, but we would like to emphasize a "translational"
                      mindset by integrating information from clinical and
                      applicative aspects.

                      Anatomical training is necessary. For example, students
                      should learn how to dissect mouse embryos to isolate brain
                      promordia. Basic histological techniques such as how to
                      fix the specimen using fixatives such as paraformaldehyde,
                      and then how to make a frozen block for further sectioning
                      of the sample should be understood. Then, obtained
                      sections will be stained using classical dyes or by using
                      antibodies. Immunostained sections will be inspected using
                      fluorescent microscopes. Images will be captured using CCD
                      cameras and processed to make informative figures. For
                      live imaging, slice culture techniques will be learned and
                      practiced. On-stage cultures will be performed and images
                      will be filmed. Cellular behaviors captured in movies will
                      be analyzed quantitatively and statistically.{" "}

                      stability. Their physiological relevance are presented and
                      actively discussed. Basic techniques for molecular and
                      cellular biology required for the genome dynamics research
                      will be studied. Those include molecular cloning of the

                      It has been becoming clear that mitochondrial dysfunction
                      plays an impotant role in induction of senescence and
                      premature senescence in humans, animals and cultured
                      cells. Therefore, telomera shortening and free radical
                      theory of ageing should be reconsidered at this moment.
                      Metabolic changes occured through mitochondrial
                      dysfunction. In the course, mitochondrial membrane
                      potentials of cultured cells are manipulated by expression
                      of UCP2 (uncoupling protein). We will discuss the

                      phosphorylation and morphological changes.

                      caused by microbial infections (virus, bacteria and
                      fungus) or toxic materials which induce tissue damage.
                      Then we learn that our immune system recognizes them using
                      receptors, eradicates microbes and repairs damaged
                      tissues. Specific microbes such as hepatitis C and
                      continued or carcinogenetic stimuli can overcome the
                      immune system and lead to tissue failure or the
                      development of cancer.

                      For protein expression, various expression systems such as
                      E. coli, yeast and insect cells are available. The yeast
                      expression system offers several advantages over other
                      systems since it allows to produce a large amount of
                      correctly folded disulfide-bonded recombinant proteins. In
                      this training course, EGF domains of Notch receptors are

                      Substantial difficulties of dynamic systems in the real
                      world lie in the involvement of a large number of related
                      factors that deviate statistically. Multivariate analyses
                      and statistics are common tools for understanding and
                      modeling these intricate systems. This course is arranged
                      for those who had few opportunities to study statistics,
                      multivariate analyses, and some basis for these
                      mathematics. We learn intermediate topics of classic and
                      modern multivariate analyses and related statistics. We
                      also practice how to apply each method of multivariate
                      analysis on real data and interpret the results.

                      There is no doubt that a considerable portion of pollution
                      emissions result from transportation related activities
                      and vehicular movements in particular. Managing traffic
                      safely and efficiently is one of the most effective
                      solutions to relieve environmental issues worldwide.
                      Training specialists who have the knowledge and skills of
                      traffic engineering is highly demanded especially in
                      developing countries where travel demand is rapidly
                      increasing despite insufficient transportation
                      infrastructure. In this course, fundamentals and
                      international issues in traffic engineering are to be
                      covered in theory and practice, so that students can

                      Water pollution and solid waste are some of the major
                      environmental problems facing our society today. In this
                      class we will learn about various technologies and
                      measures applied to the drinking water supply, control of
                      pollution of water bodies, and solid waste management.

                      to academic writing in English. We will focus on cleaning
                      up common errors of grammar, collocation and word choice.
                      We will use paragraph structure as a starting point to
                      expand in to longer essay formats, focusing on how to
                      formulate sound topics, concluding sentences, and
                      providing supporting information. Some of the classes will
                      also be conducted like workshop sessions, where the
                      instructor works closely with students in small groups.
                      Evaluation will be based on in-class and homework
                      assignments as well as some short writing assignments.
                      Students will use workshop sessions to formulate topics
                      for their writing assignments. The small-group sessions
                      will also feature peer review and revision to encourage
                      collaborative habits and allow students to learn from, and

                      also focusing on more specific issues relating to academic
                      writing, such as document formats and style guides, citing
                      and footnoting, and avoiding plagiarism. Another goal is
                      to familiarize students with a number of different essay
                      formats, such as contrastive essays and argumentative
                      essays. Within each topic of study we will also examine
                      grammar-related problems that frequently occur. Students
                      will use their own thesis or dissertation topic as the
                      basis for in-class and homework assignments with the goal
                      of improving the quality of their work prior to submission

                      Particular references will be given to the learners in
                      developing countries and issues encountered there. For
                      that objective, the students will be exposed to the

                      hot issues in the subject of infrastructure development.
                      This includes transportation and urban development,
                      regional development, the global environment including
                      climate change, disaster risk management, and other trends
                      and topics in recent development cooperation. Some
                      lecturers will offer the lecture through their practical
                      experiences related to the above subjects. The student is
                      given the assignment of both report and presentation.
                      There are some presentation/report themes presented by the
                      lecturers, which are related to the above subjects. Each
                      student needs to choose one out of the presented themes
                      and make a presentation (individual or group) in the
                      latter part of this course. They must also submit a report

                      The course discusses the practical side of development
                      cooperation that participants have to know about to work
                      on projects. Firstly, we will study World Bank aid
                      strategy including activities in the International
                      Development Association of the World Bank group.
                      Development practitioners should not be isolated from what
                      is going on in the international aid community.
                      Understanding of aid strategy in the international aid
                      community will not only help participants work together
                      with other development institutions in donor meetings but
                      also enhance the impact of projects and improve their
                      quality. The second topic of the course is about credit
                      risk analysis. Participants will study debt crisis as a
                      consequence of project lending without credit analysis on
                      repayment capability. Familiarity of macroeconomic risk
                      management of the projects is crucial for development
                      practitioners in identifying projects, funding them and
                      managing them. We will work through several criteria
                      broadly employed by aid organizations including JICA, the
                      World Bank and the IMF. The required level of economics
                      will be kept to a minimum (second year college level). The
                      third topic will be social protection with a focus on
                      pension system. Developing countries are aging faster than
                      developed countries. However, developing countries are not
                      well prepared against rapid aging in terms of income
                      levels as well as institutions including pension systems.
                      Income inequality is substantially higher among the
                      elderly than the national average. Reforming and
                      initiating pension systems is of urgent importance for
                      developing countries since it will take time for any
                      reforms to have an effect. The course will also cover the
                      social side of aid with many examples from the World Bank
                      and ADB. Apart from the above three topics, development

                      policy issues of development finance and related theories.
                      In the second part, we will discuss country or
                      region-specific issues of development finance and consider
                      policy recommendations based on macroeconomic situations,
                      financial crises, and MDGs based on presentations of

                      Development is inevitably political as it is fundamentally
                      related with distribution of scarce resources which are
                      very critical for us to realize "good lives". People have
                      developed various thoughts, practices and institutions to
                      tame conflicts over the resources. This course aims to
                      encourage students to precisely analyze political and
                      developmental problems of developing countries through
                      deepening their understanding on important political
                      philosophies.

                      This course aims to argue one of the most important
                      aspects of development politics: institution. Recently
                      institution has been widely employed by many social
                      scientists as the concept that occupies the centre of
                      analysis. The role of the State and its different
                      organizational levels and "capacities" have also been
                      questioned over the last decades. In this course, we first
                      address the puzzle of collective action as the limit of
                      self-government, and then discuss how institution has
                      become one of the fundamental perspectives to understand
                      political processes, policy outcomes and varieties of
                      political phenomena. We will review both classical and
                      recent works that directly tackled institutional aspects
                      of politics, so as to comprehend and critically argue the
                      most recent development of theories as well as their
                      possible application in empirical analysis. All

                      materials in advance, and actively participate in the

                      This lecture series will introduce students to basic
                      theories and approaches in international development. We
                      will begin by examining how development has been defined,
                      measured, and approached by the development community.
                      This is followed by the review of classical theories of
                      development that examine the roles of the market and the
                      state in promoting development. We will try particularly
                      to understand theories about modernization and
                      underdevelopment, the two major currents of thought that
                      explore the causes of why nations stay poor. We will then
                      look at development actors, i.e., foreign donors, aid
                      recipients, international financial institutions, the
                      United Nations, multinational corporations, and civil
                      society organizations. Lastly, we will discuss some of the
                      current issues in international development: environment,
                      rural and urban development, and health. By the end of
                      this course, students will be expected to demonstrate
                      their understanding of the evolution of development
                      theories and to enhance their ability to articulate their
                      views concerning current development issues.{" "}

                      This course considers how firm-based research, education,
                      and training contribute to the creation and dissemination
                      of knowledge and the formation and development of skills,
                      and thereby to industrial and economic development. This
                      course is divided into three parts. The first part
                      theoretically and historically analyzes the relationship
                      between skills development and economic development. The
                      second part examines the role of institutions associated
                      with the formation and dissemination of knowledge and
                      skills, such as research and development (R&amp;D)
                      laboratories, corporate training centers, and technical
                      and vocational education and training (TVET) in improving
                      industrial performance. The third part explores the
                      effects of digitization of the workplace on firm-based
                      skill formation and considers implications of the ongoing
                      process toward a "knowledge-based economy" for the nature
                      of work, the patterns of skill formation, and the labor
                      markets in developing countries. This course includes a
                      few field visits to corporate training centers in Nagoya
                      and adjacent cities for observing the actual practice of

                      two parts. Part 1 is aimed at fostering the acquisition of
                      basic knowledge and skills necessary when approaching
                      issues in educational development and cooperation. The
                      class covers major methodologies in social sciences, as
                      research in educational development and cooperation
                      inevitably requires an interdisciplinary approach. Part 2
                      provides an overview of practices in international
                      cooperation in education. Starting with an introduction to
                      basic governance structures and organizations of
                      international cooperation, the class covers major issues
                      in the practices of educational development and
                      cooperation at various levels in education.

                      This course aims to consider the role of higher education
                      under the framework of educational development planning
                      and evaluation. Higher education plays an essential role
                      in contemporary knowledge based society, and has its own
                      context distinguished from primary and secondary
                      education. At the same time, education planning and
                      evaluation is inevitably linked with the issues of access
                      to higher education, brain drain and brain gain typically
                      occurring at the higher education level. The class covers
                      the following topics:

                      The major objective of this course is to acquire a
                      comprehensive understanding of theories and practical
                      issues on educational development and international
                      cooperation for it. The course is divided into two parts.
                      The first part is to review major theories and dimensions
                      of educational development as an area contributing to the
                      comprehensive national development, economically,
                      socially, or culturally. This part also focuses on the
                      cooperation/aid by the outside actors, mostly multi- and
                      bi-lateral donor organizations in relation to the
                      historical changes of international educational
                      cooperation from the 1960s up to the present. Normative
                      trends of educational assistance, oft-used modalities of
                      aid, and challenges of aid will be discussed. The last
                      part of the course will touch upon issues regarding
                      different aspects of formal education, such as quality of
                      teaching and learning, administration, finance, and
                      decentralization.

                      knowledge of what international law is, and how it
                      functions. International law is understood as a set of
                      rules to promote friendly relations among States and
                      international cooperation to ensure peace, human rights
                      and democracy. Due to time constraints, it does not cover
                      the entire field of international law; however, it will
                      impart a basic idea on how international law is created,
                      how it is enforced and how it is implemented.

                      This course provides an examination of the law of the
                      World Trade Organization (WTO) and the law on foreign
                      investment. It first provides a brief introduction to the
                      history and evolution of the legal framework for trade
                      liberalization and investment protection. It then proceeds
                      to examine WTO law, focusing primarily on the WTO
                      Agreement on Goods (GATT) and on the WTO Dispute
                      Settlement Understanding (DSU), while a brief overview of
                      topics such as the General Agreement on Services (GATS)
                      and financial services in the GATS as well as intellectual
                      property under the WTO will also be provided. The latter
                      half of this course deals with investment law, focusing on
                      selected substantive obligations for investment protection
                      and investment arbitration as a means of procedural
                      protection for foreign investment. The course concludes by
                      examining the developing trends towards regionalism
                      demonstrated by the ongoing negotiations of mega Free
                      Trade Agreements such as the Trans-Pacific Strategic
                      Economic Partnership Agreement, Transatlantic Trade and

                      acquire the basic knowledge and skills needed to conduct
                      interviews and surveys during fieldwork. This course first
                      introduces students to the principles of fieldwork and
                      then provides hands-on experience by doing a small
                      fieldwork project in a group of three or four students.
                      Each month, the course focuses upon a different aspect of
                      fieldwork. In April, students will learn the basics of
                      fieldwork research and research design, decide on their
                      fieldwork topic, and begin their pre-fieldwork. In May,
                      students will learn how to plan interviews, conduct them
                      in a professional way, and analyze interview data. They
                      will also learn how to present interview data effectively.
                      In June, students will learn how to create a field survey
                      and how to do basic descriptive and inferential analysis.
                      They will also learn how to present survey data
                      effectively. In July, students will first learn how to
                      make strong and credible claims based upon the evidence
                      that they have gathered. Then, each group will present
                      their findings. By the end of the semester, students
                      should have developed a strong understanding of the
                      principles and practice of fieldwork.

                      socio-economic development, or relationship between
                      development and legal systems in developing countries.
                      This course focuses on the relevant theories on LDS, and
                      case studies. Participants are required to read designated
                      reading materials (in English) on LDS before each lecture.
                      The reading list will be given in the first lecture. This
                      course also covers issues about legal culture and informal
                      law (e.g. religious law) in the modern world.

                      What is a nation, and who belongs in it/to it? How does
                      human mobility affect development on the levels of labor,
                      policy, culture and society? This course will explore the
                      concepts of nation and citizenship by examining how
                      different societies throughout the world deal with the
                      question of including or excluding the "other". This
                      examination will then expand to focus on how questions of
                      human mobility and development issues. It will look at the
                      presence of both foreign others (immigrants, refugees and

                      how different approaches are used to include or exclude

                      People saying that I am aiming to work in the UN is like
                      saying I want to take part in the Olympics. The reason is
                      that the Olympics has many games, and so in a similar way,
                      the UN has many agencies and organizations. And so it can
                      be vague as to what exactly you want to work as. In the
                      Olympics, you need to decide which sport you take part in
                      and your ability in that sport. In a similar way, in the

                      join and know your ability to work in that chosen agency.

                      development economics will be covered. For example, we
                      will discuss rural credit issues. Informal money lenders,
                      such as landlords and shopkeepers, and the offering of
                      loans with high interest rates in rural credit markets.

                      activities - both in terms of theory and practice. The
                      course is made up of three parts. Part I explores
                      frameworks for peacebuilding. In so doing, students will
                      be equipped with some conflict analysis and impact
                      assessment tools. Part II explores three basic strategies

                      This course is aimed for discussing political
                      representation and participation in developing countries.
                      This course begins with a traditional argument that the
                      system of political representation is sometimes not
                      designed necessarily to reflect the interest of people. To
                      understand this discussion practically, we start with a
                      discussion of "policy switching", that is, the violation
                      of mandate by an elected authority, which was observed in
                      some developing countries during the neoliberal era. The
                      same problem may apply in cases where the opposing
                      interests of actors prevail or the distribution of
                      disadvantages is inevitable. Then we will discuss the
                      different forms of political representation and
                      participation, the factors and conditions related to
                      collective action, and the variety of relationship between
                      governmental elites and the population. Participants are
                      required to read the assigned material and submit the
                      answers to quiz before class.

                      This course aims at deepening our macro-level
                      understanding of conflict. A broad theme is presented in
                      each class. On each theme, a short video clip will be
                      introduced. Students are expected to undertake a small
                      study project based on the video clip and share it with
                      other members of the course. By the end of the course,
                      students are expected to grasp the changing context of
                      international politics and its effects on conflict.

                      methodology in causal inference, especially the difference
                      between quantitative and qualitative analysis. Methodology
                      is one of the area where many arguments have taken place
                      during the last two decades. While many common
                      understandings have been submitted by retrospective
                      reflection and introduction of quantitative techniques
                      still many others have been left as topics of

                      This is a seminar on international law, which is often
                      called "law of war and peace." International law provides
                      the international society with order, stability and
                      standards on the basis of which international disputes
                      shall be settled. Rules of international law regulate the
                      daily conducts of states, international organizations,
                      NGOs and individuals. One of the examples is the Charter
                      of the United Nations. In this seminar, some aspects of
                      international law will be examined.

                      Each month, the course focuses upon a different aspect of
                      fieldwork. In April, students will learn the basics of
                      fieldwork research and research design, decide on their
                      fieldwork topic, and begin their pre-fieldwork. In May,
                      students will learn how to plan interviews, conduct them
                      in a professional way, and analyze interview data. They
                      will also learn how to present interview data effectively.
                      In June, students will learn how to create a field survey
                      and how to do basic descriptive and inferential analysis.
                      They will also learn how to present survey data
                      effectively. In July, students will first learn how to
                      make strong and credible claims based upon the evidence
                      that they have gathered. Then, each group will present
                      their findings. By the end of the semester, students
                      should have developed a strong understanding of the
                      principles and practice of fieldwork.

                      international level. As you know, tourism might be helpful
                      or harmful for destinations and the local people. The
                      objective of this lecture is to understand both positive
                      and negative effects of tourism in a sustainable manner.
                      This lecture includes various aspects not only economic
                      but also social and other aspects of tourism and its
                      development. An introductory textbook will be used. Also
                      various cases studies especially tourism development of
                      small island developing states will be discussed.

                      This course has an aim to understand the security issues
                      in the framework of the Charter of the United Nations.
                      First the collective security system is dealt with in
                      comparison with the old balance of power structure.
                      Secondly the changing system of UN collective security
                      after 1990 will be addressed. Finally, a moot court
                      competition will be practiced by students, who will play a
                      role as agent for the plaintiff, defendant, or judge. If
                      you have no knowledge on international law you are
                      strongly advised to take the course International

                      This course will provide an overview of some classical
                      tools of functional analysis which have been partially
                      developed for quantum mechanics. In particular, an
                      introduction to spectral and scattering theory will be
                      presented. These theories have deep connections with other
                      branches of mathematics, like PDE, operator algebras or
                      dynamical systems. Some up-to-date tools of spectral
                      theory will also be introduced, as for example commutator
                      methods for spectral theory. In order to provide a large
                      panorama on the subject together with applications, some

                      Setting aside for the time being the question of precisely
                      what the word ‚Äòmedia‚Äô means in today's rapidly-evolving
                      communication context we may say that, in very broad
                      terms, ‚Äòmedia studies‚Äô entails investigation of three core
                      areas: production (including regulation, ownership and
                      working practices), consumption and texts. Although this
                      course focuses mainly on texts it also involves a
                      consideration of the other two areas since it views texts
                      not as free-standing linguistic or semiotic phenomena but
                      as instances of discourse, that is, as the discoursal
                      aspect of social practices including those of production
                      and consumption. Moreover, although most of the media
                      texts to be studied will be in English (with some Japanese
                      too depending on the ability of the participants), we
                      shall aim to transcend national frontiers and consider how
                      media discourses are propagated and circulated on a global
                      scale. In doing so, participants will be encouraged to
                      share their knowledge and describe their personal
                      experience of media texts in their own countries, Japan
                      and elsewhere.

                    <p>
                      We shall begin in the first few weeks of the course by
                      mapping out the territory of the academic border zone
                      where media studies and discourse studies meet. This will
                      entail a discussion of the meaning of a number of key
                      terms including mediation, discourse, ideology, hegemony,
                      genre and intertextuality. The remainder of the course
                      will be devoted to an exploration of the two theoretical
                      and methodological frameworks that underpin the course as
                      a whole: systemic functional grammar (which turns out to
                      be far less boring than it sounds!) and critical discourse
                      analysis. There is a great deal of complex information to
                      be absorbed here and participants, particularly those who
                      do not have a background in linguistics, will have to put
                      in considerable time and energy in order to keep on track.
                      Those who do so successfully, however, will be rewarded by
                      the acquisition of a powerful set of theoretical tools
                      with which to approach the comparative analysis of media
                      discourse in a global context.

                      The first few weeks of the course will be spent reviewing
                      the theoretical concepts, methodological techniques and
                      key issues introduced in the previous course. The
                      remainder of the course will be devoted to two activities
                      to be conducted in parallel. The first will be the
                      selection, development and implementation of a student-led
                      group media discourse analysis project. The findings of
                      this project will be reported on as a series of Powerpoint
                      presentations. The second will be the study of selected
                      advanced readings in this field and discussion of some of
                      the key issues arising therefrom. This will culminate in
                      the production of individually authored written papers. As
                      with the previous course, although most of the media texts
                      and discourses to be studied will be in English we shall

                      discourses are propagated and circulated on a global

                      share their knowledge and describe their personal
                      experience of media texts in their own countries, Japan
                      and elsewhere.

                      In order to acquire a deep understanding of Japanese
                      culture and society, students will use a technology,
                      industrial field, particular company or product that
                      interests them as a basis for investigating Japanese
                      technology through comparison of that same case in their
                      country of origin or elsewhere. At least one presentation
                      on this comparative research is assigned to each student
                      during the course in addition to the final paper.

                      Studies on native Japanese speakers are first introduced
                      to identify how native speakers process their first
                      language, (L1) Japanese. Based on L1 Japanese studies, the
                      Japanese processing mechanism of JSL learners, such as
                      native Chinese, Korean and English speakers, are examined
                      by reading previous publications related to JSL processing
                      and acquisition. New techniques such as
                      electroencephalography (EEG) and eye-tracking are utilized
                      in the experimental field of psycholinguistics and are
                      applied to JSL learners. Therefore, previous studies that
                      used these new techniques are also presented during the
                      course of 15 classes.

                      have utilized translation and expressions in foreign
                      languages in the composition of their works. The special
                      focus will be on Ezra Pound, especially his translation
                      and use of Japanese and Chinese literature, but we will
                      also pay attention to other poets and writers such as
                      Kenneth Rexroth, Rosmarie Waldrop, Theresa Hak Kyung Cha
                      and Yoko Tawada, and discuss how they use translation and

                      This course explores the social and cultural implications
                      of developments in information and communications
                      technology (ICT) and related digital media such as smart
                      phones, particularly in terms of how these have
                      dramatically altered the processes of news production,
                      distribution, and consumption and the formation of public
                      opinion. From the theoretical perspective of online
                      communication, we will investigate the influence that
                      interactive web-based communication tools such as social
                      networking services (SNS) are having on the political
                      process and consider the potential role of digital media
                      in promoting social trust and greater participation in
                      elections. In addition, we will discuss the some of the
                      negative social effects of social media such as the
                      digital divide, the knowledge gap and the gender gap.

                      with general understanding of the key terms and ideas in
                      the field. While it gives an overview of the Japanese and
                      global systems of media communications, it also examines
                      the changing relationship between the media and
                      contemporary political institutions and processes. Major
                      topics include the media's role in setting political
                      agendas; the growing importance of public opinion; current
                      international issues on Japan and Northeast Asia and the

                      ZPD, Activity Theory, and dynamic assessment will be
                      covered, as well as empirical research which examines the
                      application of such notions in relation to L2 reading,
                      writing, listening and speaking.

                      This is a practical course for students in the initial
                      stages of their Master's level research. In this course,
                      students will consider issues related to their research
                      including the formulation of research questions, research
                      design, data collection and analysis. Students will be
                      provided with ample opportunities to improve their
                      academic writing skills by writing on these aspects of
                      their research in a thesis chapter format. Students will
                      be encouraged to present their research to their peers,
                      participate in group discussions and give feedback.

                      This course is a survey of modern forms of visual
                      storytelling that flourished between the Meiji (1868-1912)
                      and mid-Sh≈çwa (1926-1989) periods. Through a series of
                      units on individual works and genres, including woodblock
                      prints, photography, ponchi-e, manga, kami-shibai ("paper
                      theater"), shashin sh≈çsetsu (photo novels), early film and
                      animation, students will gain practical knowledge about
                      the production and reception of visual narratives, with a
                      view towards gaining historical and cultural context for
                      appreciating the interplay between word and image.

                      This seminar is an introduction to Japanese visual
                      culture, from the Edo period (1603-1868) to the present.
                      In this course, we will examine how formations of cultural
                      production and visual practice have shaped national and
                      ethnic identities, consumer desires, cultural memory, and
                      the aesthetics of everyday life. Students will be
                      challenged to engage with different methodologies and
                      analytic approaches as they develop original research on
                      topics of their choosing. Students are free to work in
                      anime, film, digital media, photography, fine art, print
                      media, manga, manuscripts, or material objects.

                      During the first few weeks students will be introduced to
                      a wide range of animated works created during the past
                      decade. Then we will proceed to discussions of works by
                      major figures in the history of animation. Although
                      countries like Korea, Thailand and China have recently
                      started to produce interesting works we will limit our
                      scope to three major areas in the world: Northern America,
                      Europe and Japan. Major figures and studios chosen for
                      discussion will include Walt Disney, Fleischer Studios,
                      Ray Harryhausen, Jiri Trnka, Priit Parn, Yuri Norstein,
                      Hayao Miyazaki, Noburo Ofuji, Jan Svankmajer, Oskar
                      Fischinger, Osamu Tezuka, Winsor McCay, Norman McLaren and
                      others. There will be in-class screenings but students are
                      expected to view assigned films in advance on the internet
                      if they are available. Students are also assigned to read
                      articles related to the authors and films in discussion.
                      Our theoretical approach will be that of 'thick
                      description' as introduced by anthropologist Clifford
                      Geertz. This can be thought of as a common sense approach.
                      Trivia for the sake of trivia do not interest us. Only
                      such information that aids understanding of works of art
                      does. Students are expected to participate in discussions
                      with the instructor and with eachother. Term papers can be
                      on any topic as long as it is related to animation.
                      Students are also encouraged to give one presentation per
                      semester on a topic of his or her choosing.

                      opportunities at universities, research institutions,
                      companies, governments in Japan and overseas to acquire
                      the ability to conduct practical and applied research. The
                      internship should be conducted based on close
                      communication with Academic Advisors. Students are
                      expected to acquire practical research skills through
                      Research Training (ORT). Details of the Internship such as
                      period and terms of implementation should be decided
                      through consultation with Academic Advisor and experts at

                      Water pollution and solid waste are some of the major
                      environmental problems facing our society today. For
                      effective management of water and waste, it is essential
                      to have relevant rules, laws and policies, and the
                      appropriate institutions to monitor them. This course will
                      introduce legal, policy and institutional frameworks for
                      managing water and waste.

                      topics in modern synthetic organic chemistry. In the very
                      first part of this course, total synthesis of natural
                      products will be discussed on the basis of structural
                      types including alkaroids, polyketides, quinones,
                      terpenoids, and steroids. The second part is devoted to
                      the chemistry of functional molecules and their
                      applications to organic synthesis. Amino acids and sugars
                      as chiral pools and the structure and synthesis of
                      heterocycles will be covered. The last part will deal with
                      organometallic chemistry and its application to
                      homogeneous catalysis. These include important principles
                      of organometallic chemistry, transition-metal catalyses,
                      and catalytic asymmetric transformations.

                      Classes are conducted in an informal, communicative
                      atmosphere. Students discuss issues and work together in
                      pairs or small groups, changing partners each week in
                      order to increase communication opportunities. Most
                      lessons include a short interactive lecture.
