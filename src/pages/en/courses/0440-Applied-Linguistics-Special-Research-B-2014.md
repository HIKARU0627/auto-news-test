### Course Overview

We will widen the scope of inquiry to include comparative research of other languages and relation to theories of language formation.

### Key Features

In this course, we will deal with topics that are often discussed in Japanese linguistics and are often chosen by graduate students for their research. This practicum style course will consistently use new and fresh articles as teaching material. For this course, first, the lecturer will assign questions about problematic issues in the selected paper, and the questions will be sent to students 1 week in advance by email. Students will email the answers by the day before class, and we will discuss the answers in class.

By preparing answers to the questions before class, this creates an environment where students are able to state their ideas willingly. In addition, when faced with complicated problems, students can immediately begin deep discussions and use our time efficiently where they already have organized their thoughts.

Even in the most sophisticated articles, you will find some "weak points " when you read them carefully several times. It takes a lot of hard work to criticize correctly and connect your arguments to an article. The "Painful " process that everyone experiences when writing papers, through this class, I would like all students to experience this vicariously.

### Course Aims

Through studying the properties of various Japanese compound verbs, we will investigate the connection between vocabulary and grammar in Japanese and we will investigate the relation between semantics and syntax.

### Course Overview

We will widen the scope of inquiry to include comparative research of other languages and relation to theories of language formation. The main topics are as follows, but these will be flexible upon request.

1. Connecting conditions of compound verbs and their classification
2. Transitive and intransitive properties of compounds verbs
3. Compound verbs and grammaticalization
4. Primary verbs / secondary verbs and the difference between prefixes/suffixes and subsidiary verbs
5. Theories about secondary verbs, "~au" and "~naosu"
6. How rules of aspect relate to secondary verbs
7. Comparisons with other languages
8. Correspondence of compound verbs to compound nouns
