### Goals of the Course

In this course we will explore questions such as the following:

1. Do politics matter for development? Do international relations matter for development?
2. What are the dominant perspectives in modern politics and international relations?
3. What are our own political perspectives?
4. How do competing political systems affect development?
5. How do various global issues look through different political lenses?

### Objectives of the Course

Students will develop a basic understanding of international political issues and how they influence international cooperation and development. We will explore how political ideology and belief influence policy decisions and international engagement. Students will be asked to participate in an online simulation in which they must manage their fictional country’s development choices and international engagement and critically analyze assigned readings.

### Teaching tips

The student body at the Graduate School of International Development is exceptionally diverse (75% international students), which contributes to vibrant discussions of international politics and cooperation issues. The instructor uses a Socratic style to encourage discussion and reflection which requires active participation of all students. The use of the Statecraft simulation encourages students to apply the knowledge gained in the class to the development of their own fictional nation and reflect on the successes and failures of their choices.

A cumulative score of 60 is needed to pass. Students must attend at least 2/3 of the classes (10 of 15 sessions) to receive credit.
