### Course Overview

Pathology is one of the core lectures in medical school. Medical students are required to learn medical terminology of all diseases from head to toe and their definitions and concepts. Thus, pathology is a link between basic and clinical medicine. This class consists of general pathology, systemic pathology and case studies (clinicopathological example).

### Key Features

Understanding normal anatomic and histological structures (anatomy and histology) is a prerequisite for this course, and students will learn the concepts and terminology associated with human diseases. In general pathology, students will learn the general concepts of etiology and pathogenesis, based on current and cutting-edge science, to understand cellular degeneration and death, organ failure and neoplasm. Free radical biology, cellular signaling based on molecular biology, genetic traits and environmental factors are fully considered. We also stress the importance of morphological alterations based on pattern recognition. After general pathology, students can classify all kinds of diseases into one of these categories including degenerative, circulatory disturbance, inflammatory (infectious or autoimmune), neoplastic or others.

In systemic biology, forefront pathologists give lectures on major or important diseases in each system. Half of the lectures are laboratory training using either microscope or virtual slide system through computers. For these training, typical clinical cases are given.

### Objective of the Courses

At the end of this course, students will be able to understand all major concepts of human diseases and the corresponding terminology, and classify the diseases based on its etiology. Students will learn the typical macroscopic and microscopic findings of all the major human diseases, and will be able to diagnose major diseases under microscope.
