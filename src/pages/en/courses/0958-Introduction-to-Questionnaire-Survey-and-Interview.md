### Goals of the Course

The main purpose of this course is to understand the basic concepts and attitudes of the fieldwork approach. The instructor of this course helps students acquire the practical knowledge and skills needed for conducting participatory observation, academic interview, and questionnaire survey in the field. Among the various fieldwork approaches, this course focuses on two unstructured and semi-structured interviews, Life Story and Kikitori (short interview). Except for three classes (the first, the 14th, the last classes), every class is divided into two parts; instructor’s lecture and students’ group work session. This course comprises lectures, discussions, preparing for potential questions, interview exercise, the group presentation, and a report-writing.

1) understand basic concepts and attitudes for the fieldwork approach  
2) gain practical knowledge and skills on  
a) the research design and the process of the fieldwork approach  
b) basic manners and ethics for the fieldwork approach  
c) academic discussion and presentation  
d) analyzing collected data in the field  
e) writing the academic paper based on collected fieldwork data
