### Outline of Lecture Course

This course covers basic legal frameworks and advanced issues concerning the protection of intellectual property (IP) (e.g., patents, trademarks, copyrights). Main focus will be put on Japanese law and international treaties (such as the Paris and Berne Conventions, and the TRIPS Agreement), but laws of other major countries, particularly the US and the EU, will be also touched on.

Professor Nishii will teach the first four classes, and then Professor Suzuki will teach the rest of the classes.

### Course Objectives

This course aims at introducing students who have not studied IP law before to the basics of IP law. The course will also deal with advanced issues in IP law so that students who are familiar with this area of law would also find it interesting and useful.
