### Goals of the Course

In this course, we shall develop the scattering theory for unitary operators, mimicking the better developed theory for self-adjoint operators. The time dependent and time independent approach will be studied, and stationary expressions for the main objects of scattering theory will be constructed. With this subject, we shall also pay tribute to the seminal work of Kato and Kuroda on scattering theory.

### Objectives of the Course

Understand the role of scattering theory as a comparison theory and develop the necessary tools for applying this theory in various contexts (from dynamical systems to group representations).

### Course Content

0. Motivation
1. Hilbert space and linear operators
2. Spectral for unitary operators
3. Scattering theory
4. Scattering operator
