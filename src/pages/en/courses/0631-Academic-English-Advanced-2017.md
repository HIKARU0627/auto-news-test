### Course Overview

The objective of this course is to further enhance intermediate English language skills while developing skills in preparing and delivering presentations for academic or social purposes, including reading, speaking, listening, and writing skills. The course fosters students abilities to master academic English necessary for success at a research university such as Nagoya University. In addition to skills and knowledge cultivated in Academic English Basic and Academic English Intermediate, and communication skills cultivated in Academic English Communication, this course requires students to compose logical, clear and convincing English texts and to deliver them through clear and engaging speech to an audience primarily composed of non-native speakers of English.

### Key features

Each student researches, prepares, and delivers multiple oral presentations. Topics for the presentations develop from personal interests, to description and evaluation of a recommended vacation, to presentation of original survey research, and finally a persuasive presentation on a topic of the students own choice.

Presentation skills developed include brainstorming, planning and writing effective speeches. A presentation requires a strong introduction, logically and rhetorically sound structure, and a clear and memorable conclusion. In addition, delivery skills including voice, eye contact, and body language are developed. Students create and use visual aids of various types as appropriate to each presentation's topic. They also work on dealing effectively and confidently with questions from the audience.

In addition to students' own presentations, textbook exercises and videos of model presentations allow for additional study and understanding. Students work in groups or in pairs to evaluate exercises or model presentations. Weekly quizzes, based on the textbook exercises, help students focus appropriately.
