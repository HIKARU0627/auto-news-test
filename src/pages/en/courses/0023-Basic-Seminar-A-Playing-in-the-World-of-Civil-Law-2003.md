### Course details

Students taking this course are divided into small groups and take turns acting as plaintiff, defendant, and judge. To play their parts, the students exchange opinions in advance in a group using, for example, the bulletin board system (BBS), and consult with the faculty member about strategies via e-mail in order to prepare for the presentation of their case in class. All participants should develop presentation, presiding, and debating skills naturally as they collect information and think about how to convince others, enabling them to enjoy debating.

\*Although the lecture is offered only in Japanese, it is an excellent lecture worthy of being introduced in English.

### Key Features

The aims of this course are that students become able to identify legal issues on disputes related to daily life, to analyze those issues from different perspectives, to acquire presentation, presiding, and debating skills regarding those issues, and to write logical sentences on relevant assigned topics. This course is conducted as a small-group seminar for students majoring in liberal arts, who have just entered the university. The course details may be considered very orthodox in terms of achieving goals, but some new ideas and techniques have been incorporated in the course.

Courses using various IT tools are conducted systematically at the Graduate School of Law at Nagoya University, with which I am affiliated. My "basic (liberal arts course) seminar" is designed to make the most of these tools in the School of Law and in university-wide Public Education. All lecture information can be obtained from the lecture homepage. Students can submit assignments through an IT tool, a system for anonymous voting that enables mutual evaluation by students.

To nurture presentation, presiding, and debating skills, which were completely suppressed in high school, the following efforts are also made. Twelve students enrolled in this course are divided into three groups of four students, and they take turns acting the roles of the plaintiff, defendant, and judge. To act their part, the students exchange their opinions in advance within their group using, for example, BBS. They can consult with the faculty member about strategies via e-mail to prepare for the presentation of their case in class. All participants should acquire presentation, presiding, and debating skills naturally as they help each other in collecting information and think about how to convince others, enabling them to enjoy discussions. Looking through the course records, you can sense the enthusiasm of students who participated in the lecture on the "Ultraman Case".

Many people may think that the study of Japanese law concentrates on memorizing the Book of Six Major Codes, but law is only one window through which we observe the world around us. In a summer assignment, an attempt was made to encourage students to identify legal issues on their own through the use of a movie and to discuss their views freely. This provided an interesting opportunity for students to observe society from the aspect of law. This assignment was also effective for enhancing their presentation skills.
