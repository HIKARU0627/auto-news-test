### Goals of the course

Physics is at the foundation of science and engineering. This is the second of a series of four courses that cover the fundamentals of physics. The first 2/3 of this course covers further topics in mechanics: rotation, torques, angular momentum, static equilibrium, gravitation, oscillations and the remaining 1/3 of the course introduces thermal physics. Besides learning to solve problems within each topic, students will also learn to solve problems that cut across these topics.

### Key features

Students are expected to participate actively in class activities throughout the course. Students without a good background in high school physics and basic calculus are expected to have to spend more time in this course, and are advised to take this into consideration when deciding their course load. Registration for Fundamentals of Physics Tutorial Ib is strongly recommended as it serves as tutorial for this course. The course is divided into two parts. One is taught by Prof. Tama (Thermodynamics, Gravitation, Oscillations). The other one is taught by Prof. Gelloz (rotation, torques, angular momentum, static equilibrium). In the lectures a hybrid Projector / blackboard style is used.

### Pre-requisite and other requirements

- To take Fundamentals of Physics II, you must also enroll in Fundamentals of Physics I. (You cannot study Fundamentals of Physics II without taking Fundamentals of Physics I first.)
- Note that this course commences after Fundamentals of Physics I; nevertheless, you must register for it during the normal registration period in the first few weeks of semester.
- Concurrent registration for Fundamental Physics Tutorial is required.
- Students are expected to participate actively in class activities throughout the course. Students without a good background in high school physics and basic calculus are expected to have to spend more time in this course, and are advised to take this into consideration when deciding their course load.

### Grading

Class attendance is required. Absentees must give a valid reason (e.g. doctor's certificate). The "Absent" grade is reserved for students who withdraw by November 16. After that day, a letter grade will be awarded based on marks earned from all assessment during the semester.

Class attendance: 5%; Assignments: 15%; Intermediate tests: 40%; Final Exam: 40%
