![Study of Environmental Awareness](https://ocw.nagoya-u.jp/files/127/kanban.jpeg)

### Course Contents

In this course we will examine, from a psychological viewpoint, the characteristics of awareness, attitudes and behavior towards environmental issues such as waste disposal, water treatment, transportation and energy sourcing, as well as analyzing the cause of behavior. Furthermore, we will investigate the significance of various research approaches such as action research, field experiment, quasi-experiment, social survey, and case study analysis, as well as the ways in which a psychological approach can help solve global and local environmental issues, by looking at cases of non-profit organizations and environmental volunteers.

### Key Feature

Almost all environmental problems are the result of human actions, whether as an individual or in a group. Therefore, it is important to consider human psychology when trying to understand how people perceive and react towards environmental issues. In the first lecture, students will experience the effects of a simple environmental problem (arising from the illegal dumping of industrial waste) through 'game-simulation'. Based on this experience, students will hopefully come to perceive environmental issues as issues that directly affect everybody, positioning themselves in a way in which they can try to solve these issues.

There are many instances in which psychology has been used in researching various environmental problems that arise from the mutual dependence of humans and nature. However, we cannot go into all of these in detail, so this class will be focused more on environmental issues on a local level, such as garbage and recycling, drought management, contamination by household chemicals, energy conservation and public transport. We will investigate the ways in which psychology helps us to comprehend each respective issue; as well as consider what role psychology plays in finding a solution.

### Course Aims

While exploring the ways in which people think about and act towards local and global environmental issues, students will think about what kind of role psychology plays in environmental conservation.
