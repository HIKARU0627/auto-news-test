### Course Outline

Understanding the process of language learning in and outside the classroom requires detailed analysis of interactions between teacher and learner, learner and learner, as well as learner and native speakers in his/her local communities. This course introduces the methodology of "Conversation Analysis," which grew out of sociology and is now widely regarded as one of the most robust tools for analyzing interpersonal communication. We begin with a discussion of the theoretical background and basic concepts of Conversation Analysis, and we then engage in data analysis exercises through which the students acquire skills necessary to analyze recordings of naturally-occurring real-life social interaction.

### Key Features

You may at first think that analyzing everyday conversation requires little effort because, after all, we are all familiar with everyday conversation from our experience. However, once you try to examine excerpts of real-life conversations, you may feel at a loss as to where to begin since conversational data may strike you as a mere series of random behaviors. In my course, you will first learn how to "see" orderliness in what looks like a series of random behaviors by reading some basic literature in Conversation Analysis and learning its basic concepts. Reading literature alone, however, will not enable you to grapple with messy details of actual conversational data. Therefore, I will provide you with ample opportunities to engage in hands-on data analysis. Through these hands-on exercises, you will learn how to apply the knowledge you have gained from the readings to the analysis of real-life conversations.

### Course Aim

To learn theoretical and methodological principles of Conversation Analysis and acquire the skills to analyze the structures of everyday conversation.
