### Overview

Characteristics of a mental disorder contain biological properties that hinder high-order functions of the central nervous system and also influence a patient's condition and the clinical approach required depending on environmental factors such as the psychological and social factors surrounding an individual. To understand mental disorders, it is therefore important to have multiple perspectives including biology, psychology and society.

Keeping this in mind, this class strives to deepen students' understanding of general theory content such as physical treatment focusing on grasping and evaluating mental symptoms, analyses and psychotherapy, psychological treatment (psychosocial treatment), and theories on the origins of mental disorders. We also aim for students to deepen their understandings of mental disorders ranging from those biologically based to those with strong psychological aspects by looking at each stage of life, from childhood to old age. Furthermore, from the perspective of mental disorders within society, we will allude to ethical aspects in research and judicial aspects.
