### Course Features

First, in order to convey the depth and interest of the history of political journalism, the class will introduce materials and documents from traditional Chinese, modern Chinese, Japanese and Korean origins. Secondly, in order to understand the history of political thought at a regional level, we will introduce a network of modern political thought that developed in China and a network of modern political thought that developed in Meiji Japan, and then we will move on to explain how these political thoughts came to be. Thirdly, while focusing on the history of ideology, we will consider the use of ideologies by important political philosophers to understand the big picture of the history of East Asian political thought to supplement the subject of the history of political thought.

### Lecture contents

The objective of this lecture is to understand the history of the psychological behavior that influenced domestic/international politics in East Asia, based on the context of that time. Since the collapse of the research paradigm of Oriental (East Asian) Political History of Ideas based on "Modernism", at present there is no new explanatory framework in academia. This lecture course is meant to be a preparation for establishing a new paradigm, based on the current conditions in academia. Because of this, the simplistic explanations provided by research based on "Modernism" must be abandoned and the contents of this lecture will unavoidably be more complicated. .
However, this lecture will stick to the directionality of new paradigms, which will ensure a basic level of integration in the lecture content. The directionality consists of: 1. understanding the political theory of the interplay between the subject and structure, 2. tracing the formative history of East Asians' thoughts involved in politics, in a genealogical manner, and 3. acknowledging the importance of ideological resources, from a modern standpoint.
This semester's "History of Political Thought as a Concept" will be conducted based on the methods listed above.

### Achievement goals

1. To understand the value and methods of the concept of historical politics..
2. To gain knowledge of the important political concepts in East Asia.
3. To obtain a view of the civilized reconstruction of the political concept.

### Grade evaluation

In principle, grades will be given based on examinations.

### Textbook

No textbook. Lectures will be conducted based on the distributed handouts.
