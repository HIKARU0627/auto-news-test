### Goals of the course

The objectives of this course, Development Finance, are two-holds. Firstly, the students will learn the Mundell-Fleming Model and acquire how to handle the model to analyze the impact of fiscal and monetary policy. Developing countries are vulnerable to and less resilient against external shocks. Understanding the consequence of fiscal and monetary policy in an open economy is crucial in sound economic management. Secondly, the students will learn financial market theory and risk management. The roles of banking sector, financial instruments and financial market in developing countries have become critical than ever in last few decades. This is because its congenial and detrimental reverberation on other sectors and other countries have been magnified by financial globalization and recognized so by the international community since the Asian crisis and even more after the Lehman shocks. The course will be always discussed in the context of developing countries and be conducted with many hand-on exercised based on spread sheet software.

### Objectives of the Course

The students will learn international finance and monetary policy and be able to make an economic analysis in the area of international finance and monetary policy.
