### Key Features

Lecture is given based on the lecture notes distributed in the beginning of each class. This lecture involves with some basics of calculus 3 by 3 matrix operations. It is very important for students to derive the equation introduced in this class. Therefore exercise session will be given just after the lecture. Two teaching assistants will be organizing the exercise session, and there will be about hundred students. They will be ready to answer questions about the classes. Midterm exams are also given to make sure students understand the basics of Analytical Physics.

### Course Aims

We will be reviewing the Newton's second law and its application for the case of mass system for the first part of this course. We will then focus on the vibration of multi-degree-of-freedom system and rigid-body dynamics. Furthermore we will learn about variational principles and canonical equations of motion, which are deeply related to the field of quantum mechanics.

### Requirements and recommended courses

Mechanics 1, Mechanics 2, Calculus, Linear Algebra

### Textbooks

Lecture notes are provided.

### Assignments

Practice exercises on the last part of chapter are sometimes given for homework.

<h3>Course Schedule</h3>
<p>Lecture notes consist of 11 chapters. The amount of material covered in this course is much considering that we only have 2.5 hour of class every week. Therefore, in order to enforce your ability for analytical physics, practice exercises on the last part of each chapter are highly recommended for the review.</p>

### Lecture Handouts

[Lecture Notes](https://ocw.nagoya-u.jp/files/39/Mechanics4.pdf)

Lecture notes are provided but only in Japanese. Lecture notes consist of 7 chapters containing example problems at the end of each chapter. I would like you to use these problems for your review.
