### Course Overview

In this course, we will learn about the hardware and software associated with media contents and robots. Using LEGO 'Mindstorms' robots, we'll also study robot mechanism (motors, sensors, etc,) and their programming.

### Key Features

To promote active participation in this class, the course offers many opportunities for students to think for themselves, and put their ideas to practice.

To be more specific, the backbone of this course is the LEGO robot 'Mindstorms'. With 'Mindstorms', we can create a robot with three main components (sensors, motors, and a controller), and, through Java programming language create a program to actually move the robot. By assigning various tasks for the robot to perform, in addition to making the course itself a kind of contest, one can effectively reflect on what he or she has learnt, while also making evaluation of their achievements easier to understand.

In the lessons, only the simplest, most basic programs were already at the students' disposal. This provides plenty of chances in which students can put their newly learned programs to work, without referring to other materials. Programming the robot –entering the rules and commands that allow the robot to move on its own- is no special feat, requiring no more than some trial-and-error to acquire basic programming skills. Therefore, even after this course, the programs students have learned can be put to uses other than robots as well.

In this way, besides the ordinary skills for programming, students can also acquire specialized knowledge on the mechanism and programming of autonomous robots.

### Students Accomplishments

- [Robot contest 2](https://ocw.nagoya-u.jp/files/63/robot2.wmv)

### Course Characteristics

In this course, instructor and students together can evaluate their progress through the clear task of a 'robot contest'. Since the programming environment of this course uses a commonplace language (Java) and environment, students can use the skills attained in this course in their future research and careers.

### Course Contents

1. <span class="b">Practical studies using LEGO 'Mindstorms'</span>  
   Using actual objects for study will assist in improving students' skills as designers.
2.

<span class="b"> Programming practice with Java language</span>  
 We aim to understand the basic definitions of the contents and their usage.

3.

<span class="b"> Basics and practice of agents and robots</span>  
 We'll study the building methods and adaptations of autonomous systems, specifically the interaction between the physical environment, humans, and systems.

### Assignments

Students are to file a paper on how they contributed to creating the group's robot. Contents to be noted:

- the structural characteristics of the robot
- improvements made to the software
- overall contribution of each member in the groupwork (note percentage as well)
- comments regarding the course, questions, etc.
