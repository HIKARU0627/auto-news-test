### Goals of the Course

Differential equations and dynamical systems are playing an essential role in many research fields, and in particular for describing the evolution of systems. Our goal is to provide the necessary background information for understanding these evolutions and their asymptotic behaviors. The presentation will be accessible to all students, independently of the major.

### Objectives of the Course

Study the basic abstract theory of differential equations and dynamical systems, and discuss some applications according to the interest and to the motivation of the students.

### Course Content

1. Introduction through examples
2. First order linear systems
3. Initial value problems
4. Dynamical systems
5. Examples in 2D
6. Dynamical systems in higher dimensions
7. Discrete dynamical systems

### Lecture Notes

[The cumulative notes](http://www.math.nagoya-u.ac.jp/~richard/teaching/f2021/Eqdif_dynsys.pdf)

### Course Prerequisites and Related Courses

Basic knowledge on calculus and linear algebra, as provided in Calculus I & II and in Linear algebra I & II.
Motivated 1st year students can also attend without these prerequisites but after a discussion with the instructor.

### Course Evaluation Method and Criteria

The final grade will be based on the active participation during the lectures and on some written reports.
Students will be encouraged to work on applications related to their major during the semester.

### Study Load (Self-directed Learning Outside Course Hours)

Students are expected to read their notes, and to be familiar with the content of the previous lectures before each new lecture.
