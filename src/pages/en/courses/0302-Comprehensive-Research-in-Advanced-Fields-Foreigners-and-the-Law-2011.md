{overview lang="en" header="Course Overview"}

### Key Features

It is difficult to say that sufficient knowledge about law and policy on foreigners is provided in first- and second-year classes at the Law School. Nevertheless, on one hand foreigner policy comprises a focal point for the future course of Japanese society, and it is becoming increasingly important for lawyers to study the circumstances and factors behind its change. And, on the other, this particular area provides us with suitable materials for testing whether the basic knowledge provided in previous courses can be developed and put into practice in an emerging field.

Based on the above, in this course, a faculty member specialising in international law will provide fundamental knowledge as the co-ordinator and the lecturer of most classes. At the same time, faculty members majoring in other legal fields and/or foreigner policy, as well as practitioners, have been invited to teach part of the course, in order to cast light on the field from a variety of angles.

What are the actual issues at hand? Whilst being conscious of the concrete aspects of the various problems, how should one tackle them from the perspective of legal theory? The course has been devised so as to have students constantly contemplate the above.

Furthermore, although restricted by time, the instructor will endeavour to provide the opportunity for interaction by posing as many questions as possible.

### Course Aims

1. To observe the situation of foreigners in Japan through the eyes of the law, and grasp the general trend and background thereof.
2. To acquire basic knowledge of the major problems related to the ICRRA, including practical aspects, and to approach the framework of the Act with a critical mind.
3. To acquire basic knowledge of the content, nature and applicability of regulations established in international law, which constitute important factors in changes evident in the ICRRA.
4. To acquire basic knowledge of the recent debate surrounding legal policy on foreigners, and the background thereof, in order to be prepared to deal with future changes.
5. To learn the fundamentals of research surveys with respect to the ICRRA.

### Prerequisites

It is desirable for students to have already taken &ldquo;International Law II&rdquo;, as offered by the Law School, or an equivalent course offered at the School of Law.
