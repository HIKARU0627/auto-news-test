### Course Overview

Field Seminar I is an exercise to deepen our understanding about knowledge we obtained in the course of earth and planetary science through actual outdoor observations. Although students learn that rocks are simply classified into few types, when we actually observe them in the field, rocks of the same type show various characteristics and we notice the variety of the nature. The history of the earth built on over thousands or millions of years is engraved in these rocks and layers providing with various information. Understanding as much information as possible will lead to understanding of the earth. In this exercise, we aim to deepen our understanding from earth and planetary science course as well as learn observation skills in the field.

### Course Tips

In order to deepen our understanding of knowledges we learn in the earth and planetary science course by looking at real rocks and layers, we take these steps:

1. observe carefully
2. Ask a leading question regarding the matter we want to pay attention to.
3. Explain the meaning of the observable phenomena

Through these steps, we are devising ways for students to observe,think and understand by themselves

### Goals

To actually look at rocks and layers as well institutions affiliated with Earth science in the field. We can depend our understanding of the basic knowledge of earth science phenomena by being in touch with the real things as well as provide the ability to think about the meaning of earth science. We will also aim to broaden our insight by visiting some institutes and observing geology.

### Course Requirements

none

### Textbook

none

<h3>Course schedule</h3>
<p>September - October: learning the basics of geology (3 one-day visits to Unuma, Ibigawa-town (former Kasuga-town) and Mizunami in Gifu)
Observation of layers, rocks, minerals, and the structure of geology, and the basics of stratigraphy (how to draw geologic columnar sections)
</p>
<p>November: researching the expansion of layers (one night trip to Toei-town, Aichi). In preparation for the exercise of the geological survey, we will learn geologic phenomena through popular experiments with rocks, drawing geologic columnar sections, and methods of this survey.
</p>
<p>Summer or autumn: Professors on earth physics and earth chemistry host field exercise every other year. In 2014 there is an exercise on earth physics.
