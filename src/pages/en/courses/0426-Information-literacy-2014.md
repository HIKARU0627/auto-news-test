### Course Overview

The objective of this course is to acquire information literacy, which is the basis of academic activity at a university. Through lecture and hands-on practice, this course aims to give students, especially undergraduate students in the humanities, the knowledge of how to utilize information related technology, including the transfer, gathering, organization and analysis of information. As information related technology changes rapidly with the times, rather than memorizing how to use existing software and knowledge, this class focuses more on searching for necessary information and thinking about how to use new software.

Following the previously stated objective, the first half of this course deals with gathering information; including "Email," "Internet search engines," and "Libraries and Utilization of Materials." The second half of the class addresses the expression of information including "Information Ethics and Netiquette", "Representations on Web Pages", "Analysis by Spreadsheet Programs", "Presentation".

### Key Features

In order to allow students to participate more independently, lectures during the first part of each class will be kept to a minimum, and the last part of the class will consist mainly of hands-on activities. To create an environment where students can participate independently, classes will be held in an I-room, a room where student's PCs are connected to the instructor's PC which is being projected on a screen at the front of the class so that comments and questions are projected in real-time.

During the tutorials, the teacher and 3 TAs will take questions while circulating through the room and support students as they progress at different rates. Additionally, along with assignments, students are required to submit reflections after each class to the CMS (class assistance web page), and the instructor and TAs will comment on their reflections by the next class.

### How to withdraw from the class

If a student fulfills the following conditions, he/she will be graded "Absent".

- If the student requests the withdrawal before the end of May
- If the student is absent from more than 30% of all classes
- If the student does not submit the final assignment

A participant who does not fulfill the above and whose grading is below 60 points, is graded "F".
