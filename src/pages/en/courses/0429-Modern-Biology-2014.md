### Course Overview

The purpose of this course is to learn the philosophy, principles, and techniques of modern biology. The course is particularly designed for those who have not learned biology previously or whose major is other than biology, and who may think that they do not need to know any biology at all.

The topics are covered in a rather general, overview manner, but certain level of diligence in grasping concepts and memorizing the terminology is expected.

### Course Aims

The purpose of this course is to learn the philosophy, principles, and techniques of modern biology. The course is particularly designed for those who have not learned biology previously or whose major is other than biology, and who may think that they do not need to know any biology at all.

The topics are covered in a rather general, overview manner, but certain level of diligence in grasping concepts and memorizing the terminology is expected.

### Textbooks

Campbell Essential Biology, 4th Edition, by Simon, Reece, and Dickey (Pearson Education, 2007)

Note: Those students that already own Campbell Biology: Concepts and Connections, which was used in the course Fundamentals of Biology I, do not have to purchase the Essential Biology book; they can study perfectly well from the book that they already have.

### Prerequisite

If your name is not listed on the class roll you cannot attend lectures within this course. If you want to attend specific lecture and your name is not listed on the class roll, please make request at least 2 weeks in advance (Communication)

### Lecture Handouts

Topic #12

- [DNA technology](https://ocw.nagoya-u.jp/files/429/Topic 12_DNA technology.pdf)

### Grading

- Two Exams
- Final Exam
- Activity during class

Grade "S":100-90%, "A":89-80%, "B":79-70%, "C":69-60%, "F":59-0%.

It is essential to sit in each exam during the scheduled class time. There will be NO make-up exam. In the event of a missed exam due to a serious illness, accident or family emergency, compelling written documentation of the reason for the absence will be required. If the reason is accepted, the final grade will be calculated from the appropriately weighted average from the rest of the exams. If the reason will be deemed insufficient, the absence will be unexcused, and zero points will be awarded for the missed exam. Exam grades will be posted in the Gradebook on the Course website before next class period.
