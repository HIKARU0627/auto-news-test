### Course Overview

This course teaches students how to make an academic presentation. Specifically, they will learn how to turn a published academic paper into a high-quality, clear and concise presentation. Each week’s lecture builds on what was learned the week before, step-by-step, until students have a completed presentation. This “rough” presentation is then further refined and improved for a final in-class presentation.

### Course Goals

The central aim of this course is to improve students’ presentation skills and to help students understand and create their own academic presentation based on a thorough understanding of 1) observations / problems 2) research questions / objectives, and 3) thesis statements / hypotheses. We will then use this basic framework to move to more advanced topics. Students will dissect and understand a work of their choosing as a basis for their presentation. Students will also learn how to write a proposal/abstract for their work. Students will present twice during the semester using the skills learned throughout the course. As necessary, most classes will contain a lecture dealing with specific aspects of presentation skills. Class activities and materials will be oriented around pair and small group work.
