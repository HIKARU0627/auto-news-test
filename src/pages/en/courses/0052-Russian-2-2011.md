### Course Objects

This course begins with the practice of pronunciation. Its primary objective is to develop the basic skills essential for the comprehensive and effective acquisition of Russian grammatical structures and for reading written texts. Moreover, the course will enable students to comprehend written texts with the help of a dictionary and to acquire the correct way of constructing expressions and sentences by themselves. This will be the basis and the first step for further learning and using the Russian language.

### Key Features

This may be the first time that students learn a foreign language other than English. They will learn Russian from the very beginning. As there is only a small number of students in each class, the progress is comparatively fast. The classes are interactive and create the atmosphere of a play, in which students acquire the basic knowledge of grammar, construct sentences by themselves, and speak in the Russian language. Class assignments will be regularly graded. Four basic skills, namely reading, writing, listening and speaking will be developed through everyday practice.

### Course Overview

The primary objective of this course is to develop the basic skills of the Russian language. Equal attention is given to four areas of learning, namely reading, writing, listening and speaking. Assignments mainly include dialogues and expressions used by Russian native speakers in everyday life. Moreover, the usage of audio-visual materials allows students to learn about Russian culture, customs, history and society and, thus to gain a better knowledge of the Russian-speaking countries and wider world.

<h4>Dictionaries</h4>
<p>
Although it is well known that using a dictionary is essential when learning a foreign language, you will not need a dictionary at the beginning of the course. In Russian, word endings often change in a very complex way. So even if students are able to extract a necessary word from a dictionary, they may find difficulties in selecting the correct ending. Therefore, it would be more effective to gradually expand the use of dictionaries after making some progress in learning grammar. Thus, we advise students to make a list of new words by themselves.
