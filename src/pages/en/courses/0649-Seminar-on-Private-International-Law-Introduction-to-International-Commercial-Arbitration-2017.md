### Course Overview

International commercial arbitration is becoming more and more important in the field of cross-border disputed resolution. While most advanced nations already are already familiar with arbitration, there is a growing demand of expertise in this field from recent developing countries. The regulatory framework in the world is moving towards a "globalized" arbitration: there is widespread acceptance of international models as base for legislation (e.g. the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration) and the circulation of awards is made smoother by effective international instruments (e.g. the 1958 New York Convention of the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards), However, many countries are lagging back in term of effective appliance of those international tools: national resistances (both legislative, judicial and political) and the lack of arbitration theoretical and practical expertise among legislators, judges and professional operators is jeopardizing an effective and homogeneous success of arbitration all over the world. One tool to subvert this situation is trying to provide law students with a strong basis of notions in this field. This seminar focuses on both theoretical and practical issues in arbitration, covering a wide spectrum of subjects in order to provide a comprehensive picture of what international arbitration is.

### Teaching Tips

1. English is the primary language of International Commercial Arbitration. Most students (and instructors!) at Nagoya University are not native English speakers, so do not worry: irrespective of your proficiency you are strongly encouraged to take part in the discussion and to express your opinions.

2. This seminar is aimed to provide students with a general and broad knowledge of international commercial arbitration. We will start on the assumption that students do not possess a structured understanding of what international commercial arbitration is. For students with knowledge of international commercial arbitration this seminar will be useful for brushing up and filling gaps: you are, however, very welcome to ask for further readings if you are interested in a specific subject.

3. We will be using several categories of readings:<br>
   a. Scholarly writings, articles<br>
   b. Laws, treaties, documents from arbitral institutions<br>
   c. Materials prepared specifically for this seminar<br>
   d. Documents (awards, etc.) taken from real cases<br>
   You may be required to read the relevant materials in advance and to be prepared to discuss it during lessons

### Aim

The aim of the seminar is to provide students with effective knowledge of international
commercial arbitration. First, a general overview of the subject will be presented, in order to allow
everybody to have a common frame of reference. Then, each single phase of the procedure will be
analyzed in detail, from the arbitration agreement to the recognition and enforcement of the award.
To better understand the interaction between theoretical and normative framework and practical
problems, students will have to read and comment also on materials taken from actual cases. After
the end of the seminar, students should have acquired a good knowledge of, inter alia, the
UNICTRAL Model Law, the New York Convention and the main problems and issues which are
currently debated among arbitration scholars and practitioners.

### Textbooks

due to the peculiar nature of the seminar, there is no need of a general textbook for
students. Lessons will be based on specifically created Power Point presentations. Also, copies of
some relevant readings will be distributed to students on a regular basis, via the online syllabus
system. However, as a support textbook, students may want to use N. Blackaby, C. Partasides (with
Alan Redfern and Martin Hunter), Redfern and Hunter on International Arbitration - Student
version, Oxford, Oxford University Press, 6th edition, 2016.

### Reference Materials

In addition to the materials mentioned under "Textbooks" above, other
handouts and reading materials will be will be distributed to students via the online syllabus system.
A preliminary list will be distributed during the first class.
