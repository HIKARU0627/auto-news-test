### Course Overview

To correctly implement the penal code, procedures that identify the facts of a crime and assess the sentence to be imposed are necessary. These procedures are Criminal Procedures (Penal proceedings). In this class, following procedural steps from investigation to prosecution and trial, along with a summarization of each step, we will examine important problems that arise from these procedures.

### Key Features

Each class is divided into 4 parts. At the beginning of each class, I will introduce the object of that day's lesson and the general itinerary and. Next, in accordance with procedural steps, I will explain legal concepts and legal interpretations [legal hermeneutics]. I will also give practice problems that we will discuss on the spot. At the end of class, I will comment on the problems and introduce relevant corresponding precedents. The cycle of learning and thinking is repeated each class encouraging the development of knowledge and critical thinking.

### Course Aims

Along with the acquisition of elementary and fundamental knowledge of general criminal law proceedings, students will question the implications of the basic institutions of the Criminal Procedure Code. Students will also acquire the habit and ability to think critically.

### Textbooks

Lecture outlines, power point slides and handouts.
