### Course Aims

Literary works are created in relation to literary traditions, and one of the classic subject matters of literature has been "food culture." This time, we will consider and compare various works with regard to the theme of "self-starvation."

### Key Features

1. About the production of teaching materials:
   Teaching materials had been prepared in advance, so that short items could be photocopied and longer items could be borrowed. There were of course literary works, commentary pieces and essays as set texts. I also used audio materials, and as with all the other materials, they were circulated in class. In the case of Miyazawa Kenji's works, I used numerous picture books as materials to point out the vast diversity of interpretations that were possible.

2. About class methods:
   As the classes were conducted in the form of lectures, I managed the time so that I could ask the students their opinions about that day's task at the start of the class and so that we could have another discussion after we had finished an assignment.

### Learning Outcomes

- The term paper actually was about all literary works covered in class. Each student chose various works as a theme for the paper, such as <cite>Yodaka no Hoshi</cite>, <cite>Kuwazu Nyobo</cite>, <cite>Wuthering Heights</cite>, and <cite>Bungaku Shojo and the Ravenous Ghost</cite>, and they were not encouraged to concentrate on any one particular work. At the least, students were able to write an academic report in the form of a logical argument, from formulating a hypothesis, through critical interrogation, to the rendering of conclusions.
- I received a comment from one foreign student saying that although he had read Japanese newspaper articles in order to try to learn the language, he hadn't read any Japanese literary pieces in his home country. This class had inspired him to try dealing with Miyazawa Kenji's works in his language lessons. I can say there were results from the fact that he was able to learn by himself that understanding literary works leads to a fruitful understanding of Japanese language and culture.

### Course Requirements

None

### Assignments

A mandatory task set for every lesson is intensive pre-reading of literary works and essays that will be analyzed in class. Among other things, students are expected to be able to explain the gist of each work from their pre-reading.

<h3>Course Schedule</h3>
<p>
While considering first the true nature of the illness known as anorexia, we will then look through literary works such as those detailed beneath. I plan to cover Anglo-American literature, and so that people who can't read English can still understand I will also prepare Japanese translations.
</p><p>
When I last did an explanation of the class structure, the class also included foreign students who needed to study Japanese culture. I have reconsidered the literary works used in the course accordingly and have incorporated Japanese texts as much as possible.
