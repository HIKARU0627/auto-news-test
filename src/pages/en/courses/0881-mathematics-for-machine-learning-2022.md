### Course Purpose

The purpose of this lecture is to give a basic mathematical introduction to machine learning.

### Content

1. Overview of machine learning
2. (Linear) Regression
3. Review Linear Algebra
4. Programming & doing mathematics in Python
5. Introduction to Probability
6. Support vector machines
7. k-means clustering
8. Neural networks
9. Deep learning

### Course Prerequisites

Basic knowledge in Linear Algebra and Calculus is helpful. We will also do some programming in Python. Programming knowledge are useful but not necessary since a rough introduction to programming in Python will be part of the course. Motivated 1st-year students can also attend without these prerequisites if they contact the lecturer beforehand.
Due to the programming part of the lecture, students should have (access to) a computer/laptop.
