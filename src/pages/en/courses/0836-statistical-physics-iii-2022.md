### Goals of the Course

Statistical Mechanics is one of the major fields of physics: around 30% of Physics Nobel Prizes have been awarded for discoveries directly or indirectly related to Statistical Mechanics, particularly condensed matter physics, phase transitions and field theories. The principles and methods are applicable in many fields of physics, including condensed matter physics (e.g. Bose Einstein Condensation, superconductivity, materials science) and high energy physics (spontaneous symmetry breaking, lattice gauge field theories, the Higgs Mechanism (which is a type of phase transition) and so on) as well as astrophysics (neutron stars, simulations of galaxy evolution, and so on). The principles and methods are also applicable in a very wide variety of fields outside physics, such as biology, neuroscience, modelling of pandemics, network theory, machine learning and artificial intelligence. G30 students in the past have shown that students in chemistry, chemical engineering and materials science with a thorough grounding in the principles of Statistical Mechanics have a significant advantage over their peers who do not possess this grounding.

### Course Overview

This is the second part of a full-year, advanced Year 3 course in statistical mechanics and thermodynamics. Exchange students should only consider taking this course if they average 80% or above in their university's quantum mechanics, statistical physics and mathematics units, and if they are prepared to work hard.

At the end of this course, students will have mastered basic aspects of quantum statistics of ideal gases, statistical mechanics of systems of interacting particles, and the theory of phase transitions and critical phenomena, including modern topics such as the scaling hypothesis, an introduction to renormalization group theory (the spatial renormalization group), and the Bogolyubov Variational Theorem and its application to constructing an optimal Mean Field Theory. One overarching goal is to develop the intuition for why quantum field theory can be applied to condensed matter systems, without going into quantum field theory: the course is a precursor to Year 4 quantum field theory.

In this course, students learn quantum statistics of ideal gases, introductory statistical mechanics of systems of interacting particles, introductory theory of phase transitions and critical phenomena, Mean Field Theory, and some modern theory such as the scaling hypothesis, an introduction to renormalization group theory (the spatial renormalization group), and the Bogolyubov Variational Theorem and its application to constructing an optimal Mean Field Theory. Students will encounter the ideas of spontaneous symmetry breaking, universality, critical exponents, transformation between -- proof of equivalence of -- various models such as the Two-state Ising Model, Lattice Gas Model, Binary Alloy Model and Two-state Potts Model.

### Study Load (Self-directed Learning Outside Course Hours)

This course is part of your training to be a professional researcher. You are expected to revise the lecture notes, read and work through the textbook, and solve assignment problems outside lecture hours. You cannot learn physics by only attending lectures. The exams will consist of questions covering both lecture notes and assignments.

Students must be willing to work hard if they want to achieve a good, internationally competitive level.
