### Teaching tips
When students hear "business Japanese," many may think that honorific language is difficult or that they need to learn company rules. Indeed, many commercially available textbooks emphasize practicing how to speak and behave in corporate settings.  

However, before focusing on those aspects, it’s important to study Japanese while preparing for job hunting or further education, especially if you're considering working for a Japanese company. In this course, while gathering information and asking questions about job hunting and work-related topics, you will reflect on your own career path. Through activities such as writing entry sheets, participating in group discussions, and attending mock interviews, the goal is to improve your Japanese language skills.  

By learning in this class, I hope you can apply the Japanese skills you’ve developed so far to your career development.  

Additionally, the textbook used in this course, "Career Support Handbook for Business Japanese," is designed not only for classroom use but also for self-study. During class, students will participate in practical activities such as case studies and group discussions, working together to exchange ideas. I strongly recommend joining the class, as participating in classroom activities will offer more learning opportunities.
