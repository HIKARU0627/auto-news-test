### Goals and Objectives of the Course

In this training, you will learn how to handle animals, plants and microorganisms, how to observe them, and how to operate experimental observation instruments. The aim is to gain a basic understanding of the structure and function of various living things through their observation by the naked eye or through a microscope, their dissection and by experimentation on them. The goal is also to learn how genes are related to structure and function, so you can understand the flow from classical biology, which had observation as its main objective, to modern biology, which pursues understanding on the molecular level.

### Course Prerequisites

In this training, experiments and observations on animals (medaka, fly, nematode), plants (onion, Arabidopsis), microorganisms (yeast), and collection and observation of oral epithelial cells or a few drops of blood areperformed. We do not recommend them to students who cannot do them for any reason.

### Course Contents/Plan

1.  Guidance and safety education<br>
2.  Observe plant cells<br>
3.  Plant shaping and response to gravity stimulation<br>
4.  Observation of the yeast cell cycle<br>
5.  Observation of cell division at onion root growth point<br>
6.  Observation of nematodes: effects of genetic abnormalities on animal morphology and movement<br>
7.  Looking at the genome and thinking about the information content (Drosophila larval salivarygland chromosome observation)<br>
8.  Observing the feeding behavior of Drosophila: what food do you like? Hate?<br>
9.  Learn evolution and biodiversity from medaka<br>
10. Properties of enzymes (alkaline phosphatase)<br>
11. Comparative observation of human blood cellsand epithelial cells<br>
12. Measurement of cell osmotic pressure by plasma separation

The contents and order may change.

### Course Evaluation

MethodsAttendance and report for each experiment. As a general rule, students will not be able to earn credits unless they are present and submit reports on all practical trainings by the deadline. If you attend three or more times, your grade will be "S, A, B, C, or F" instead of "Absent."

### Notice for Students

In the first class, be sure to attend the training courses, which will provide you with practical training guidance, safety education, and instructions for purchased items. In subsequent lessons, read the texts in advance and understand the purpose of the experiment before starting the lesson. If you are absent from the training or your report submission is delayed due to some circumstances, be sure to contact and consult the training teacher in advance.

### Textbook

Exclusive original training books will be distributed.

### Reference Book

Prints will be distributed as needed.

### Message

To conduct experiments safely, carefully listen to your teacher's explanations and observe any demonstrations.
