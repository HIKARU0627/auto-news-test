### Course Overview

Banking and financial institutions are very important in the economy and worth investigating. In this course, I wish to explain the importance of financial systems and the roles of financial institutions as well as markets, based on the theory of information. Furthermore, I also try to discuss recent experiences of the Sub-prime crisis as well as other financial crises and the development of regulatory reforms. Concretely speaking, I use Frederic Mishkin's <span class="i">Economics of Money, Banking, and Financial Markets</span> (9th Edition Prentice Hall, July 2009) as a textbook and will explain Chapters 1, 2, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12.

### Key Features

All students are required to prepare well, as I often ask them to answer my questions in the classroom. On average, all students say something every two classes. In addition, whenever one chapter of the text is finished, students must answer an online quiz (consisting of 10 to 20 questions for each chapter) through the NUCT (Nagoya University Collaboration and Course Tools).

### Course Objectives

The purpose of this lecture is to organize students' thinking about the structure of financial markets and financial institution management.

### Before Taking Class

Come to class well prepared.

### Course Requirements

This class will be taught in Japanese, but English knowledge is necessary to get credit for this class.

### Related Resources
