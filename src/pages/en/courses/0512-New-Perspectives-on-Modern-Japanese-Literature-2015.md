### Course Description

"Love" at first sight appears as an obvious concept, but in reality it has undergone radical changes over time and differs depending on the cultural context. This course explores representations of love, longing, and desire in modern Japanese culture and literature. Following a brief excursion to pre-modern understandings of love and tracing its translation into a modern, westernized notion, we ask how love has been conceptualized in relation to sexuality, gender, marriage, and the modern nation state. In particular, we will discuss the (literary) representation of themes such as romantic love, postwar pure love, homosexual love, prostitution, love suicide, parental love, and more.

### Course Aims

The course is open to all 3rd and 4th year undergraduate, graduate and NUPACE students. It will mostly be taught in English but all participants should have some understanding of Japanese and ideally be able to follow discussions in both languages. Reading responses and seminar papers can be submitted in either language. Students from other Schools are welcome if they are familiar with the basics of literary analysis.

### Course Registration

The course is open to all 3rd and 4th year undergraduate, graduate and NUPACE students. It will mostly be taught in English but all participants should have some understanding of Japanese and ideally be able to follow discussions in both languages. Reading responses and seminar papers can be submitted in either language.

Students from other Schools are welcome if they are familiar with the basics of literary analysis.

### Course Content

While our focus will be on (translated) works of modern literature, we will make excursions to the pre-modern era and also read texts that look at "Love" from a historical, sociological and/ or anthropological perspective. All literary texts (but few/none of the research papers) read are available in Japanese as well.

This course is not a lecture but a reading-intensive seminar the learning outcome of which depends on your preparation and activeparticipation in class.
