### In Brief

This course provides students with a comprehensive understanding of concepts, principles, and strategies concerning the basic mechanisms underlying plant growth, development, and survival. Topics covered include mineral nutrition, solute transport, photosynthesis, respiration, metabolism, environmental and developmental signals, and plant hormone action.

### Key Features

The course is designed to give the student an opportunity to practice oral presentations. Each student gets involved in this active-learning process by giving two presentations during the 15 week-course period.

Initially the instructor gives two lectures at the beginning of the course. From class 3 of the course, one to three students per class, depending on the size of the class, are assigned to give individual presentations on a specific topic(s) from the textbook chapter (see the attached student presentation schedule of 2014). Each student presentation is followed by a question-and-answer session and a discussion session involving all students in the class. Finally, class is concluded with a lecture by the instructor that summarizes and supplements student presentations.

This active-learning method applied to the course aims to help students;

- - develop his/her oral communication skills,

- - stimulate discussion in the class,

- - become self-motivated to learn in an active and creative manner.

Examples of the student presentations (PDF files of Ppt presentation slides) from the classes of 2013 and 2014 are shown in the "Class Materials" section below.

### Teacher's Tips

In general...

- 1)Attend all classes!!!

Before coming to each class...

- 2. Read the assigned textbook chapter(s)

- 3. Prepare your questions on lecture topic(s)

In class...

- 4. Participate in classroom discussions

In making and improving your PowerPoint presentation (ppt)...

- 5. Follow presentation guidelines to organize your ppt

- 6. Send your ppt to instructor a few days prior to your presentation and get advice

- 7. Revise your ppt by including all suggestions given by the instructor

### Student Pesentation Guidelines

Each student will give a 20 minute oral presentation describing 1) a topic or topics from an assigned textbook chapter, 2) a research article referred to in the chapter, or 3) a recent research paper related to the chapter topic. The presentation will be followed by 10 minutes of questions from the audience. Here are instructions and a few and tips to help you prepare your presentation.

1. Read the textbook chapter carefully to fully understand your presentation topic. You must become an expert on the topic.
2. Figure out the major points of your presentation. What concepts are most important in introducing the topic to the audience? Keep this in mind when organizing your presentation.
3. Figure out the major points of your presentation. What concepts are most important in introducing the topic to the audience? Keep this in mind when organizing your presentation.
4. Prepare about a 20 min slide presentation. Use Microsoft PowerPoint or Apple Keynote for making your presentation. In general, plan to use a slide per minute or two in your presentation; this means that you need about 15 to 20 slides for a 20 min presentation.
5. Prepare about a 20 min slide presentation. Use Microsoft PowerPoint or Apple Keynote for making your presentation. In general, plan to use a slide per minute or two in your presentation; this means that you need about 15 to 20 slides for a 20 min presentation.
6. Prepare about a 20 min slide presentation. Use Microsoft PowerPoint or Apple Keynote for making your presentation. In general, plan to use a slide per minute or two in your presentation; this means that you need about 15 to 20 slides for a 20 min presentation.
7. Avoid &lsquo;wordy&rsquo; slides. Instead, use graphic images (i.e., photographs, drawings, diagrams, charts, etc.) from textbook, articles, or websites (or those created by yourself!!). This helps you explain complex ideas and concepts. Also, use of simple animations may be effective. IMPORTANT: Sources of graphic images, if not your own, must be acknowledged on the slide.
8. Include a slide with references at the end of your presentation.
9. If you present a research article, you must include slides to explain the following aspects;
   - the &ldquo;big question&rdquo; being asked in the article;
   - research background and history;
   - materials and methods being used for experiments and observation;
   - data generated;
   - conclusions;
   - the significance of the paper;
   - the major discovery or discoveries and remaining questions;
   - &lsquo;take home&rsquo; message(s);
10. IMPORTANT: Presentation must be submitted by e-mail to the instructor 24 hours before your presentation.
11. Submit a 2-3 page summary of your presentation via e-mail within a week after your presentation.

- [d. From the class of 2013 (Foo Wei Ten)](https://dev2.ocw.media.nagoya-u.ac.jp/system/production/fileview.php?course_id=404&filename=GA5.pdf)

### Grading

Grades will be determined by a combination of written examinations, assigned presenations, and attendance & performance (e.g., participation in discussions) in class. Homework, exams and performance will be weighted as follows:

- Presentations (2) 300 pts (150 points each\*)
- Midterm (1) 250 pts
- Final (1) 250 pts
- Attendance and performance 200 pts
- Total 1,000 pts

The semester letter grade will then be determined either by an absolute standard or on a curve, whichever benefits the students most at each letter grade cut off:

- S = 90 - 100% of the total points
- A = 80 - 89% of the total points
- B = 70 - 79% of the total points
- C = 60 - 69% of the total points
- F = below 59% of the total points

#### Criteria for Absent & Fail Grades

No Absent grade will be given in this course. Students who fail to attend 3 or more lectures will immediately get an F (Fail) grade.
