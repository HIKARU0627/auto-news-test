### Goals of the course

This is the last of a series of four courses that cover the fundamentals of physics. It focuses on mechanical and electromagnetic waves, as well as optics. Both conceptual understanding and problem solving is emphasized. Applications are discussed.

The understanding of waves in general is very important as they manifest themselves in many everyday life phenomena and in modern Physics. In my opinion, the course is very exciting to follow because:

1. among the four Fundamentals of Physics courses, it is the one most related to direct common observations and,
   - it is a valuable path to take since understanding waves and optics is essential as preparation for more advanced subjects, for example in quantum mechanics, chemistry, and engineering. </ol>

### Key features

Registration for Fundamentals of Physics Tutorial IIb is strongly recommended as it serves as tutorial for this course. Indeed, the tutorial, though technically an independent course, is used to practice the knowledge acquired in this course. In the tutorial, problem solving is practiced, and short quizzes conducted in order to assess the understanding of the materials.

In the lectures a hybrid Projector / blackboard style is used. Many concepts are introduced using real world examples via videos or direct demonstrations when possible. Numerous animations are also used, and so far they have been very much appreciated by the students, contributing to further drawing their interest in the course.

With two lectures and a tutorial (if you register for it) per week, it is important to work regularly and immediately clear any misunderstanding in order to do well in the course and tutorial.

### Course Prerequisites

Fundamentals of Physics I & II. Concurrent registration for Fundamentals of Physics III is required. Registration for Fundamentals of Physics Tutorial IIb is recommended as it serves as tutorial for this course.

### Evaluation Methods

Class attendance is required - absentee must give a valid reason. A student will receive the ABSENT grade if his lecture attendance is below 75% or if he is absent without valid reason from any scheduled test (Students do not need to submit a Course Withdrawal Form for course withdrawal).

Weightage of course components : Class attendance: 10%; Intermediate tests: 40%; Final test: 50%
