### Goals of the Course

“Laboratory in Chemistry” provides students with the basic skills required to systematically perform experiments in chemistry in an interdisciplinary, comprehensive fashion that promotes an understanding of the necessary practical and theoretical skill set to other related fields of their study as for example in Biology or Chemical Engineering.

### Objectives of the Course

The first objective of this course is to learn how to effectively perform chemical and related physicochemical experiments in a detailed, oriented manner including carefully taking notes of the procedures, results, and questions that may arise from the experiments. The second objective is to clearly and concisely convey to others the results of the experiments that support your conclusion. Motto: Perform the experiments by yourself, visually observe and take notes of your observations and measured data/results in a manner that enable you to
report your results clearly.

### Course Prerequisites and Related Courses

Students must have taken, or be taking concurrently, at least one of the following courses: Fundamentals of Chemistry 1, Fundamentals of Chemistry 2.

### Textbook

- Introductory Chemistry Laboratory Manual, Shizuaki Murata, Fumi Urano, Masahiro Yoshimura, Shuku Yoshiaki, and Hideto Ito (Nagoya University, 2021, 6th Edition)
