### Course Overview

In this class, the goal is for students to understand how law is related or can relate to solving or preventing environmental problems and to even consider legal aspects when dealing with specific environmental phenomena. For this reason, in class we will focus on getting a clear picture of the functions and characteristics of laws dealing with environmental conservation by examining concrete examples and arguments.

### Key Features

We want students who do not major in law to have a tangible image of "Environmental law." So in this semester along with the textbook, we will use papers on environmental law or specific laws as supplementary material, and have students do a report on them every class. In each class, along with the reports, the teacher will explain important points, answer questions, and conduct discussions, so as to make learning as interactive as possible.
