### Course Overview

Science makes remarkable progress. To take an instance of everyday tools, cell phones have some functions which were not expected to be a part of them a few years ago. Lately, a robot which can jog around was introduced. However, when we turn our eyes to nature, there are a lot of living things which have great functions and structures. Those functions and structures beat the latest technology. We do not know who created those living things, but we are going to look into the wisdom of this nature and think about science again.

In a seminar, students are divided into small groups. Each group examines and thinks about a point of tangency between science and nature. The results are put together for a presentation. Students need to make materials for a group presentation. Each group presents the results to the class. Then we discuss the contents with class members. At the end of this semester, students will write a final paper. Through this activity, students are going to earn the eye to look into things, the skill of telling others your opinion and the ability of understanding opinions of others.

### Students Accomplishments

Class presentation slides (which are made by students):

- [Ice cream foam](https://ocw.nagoya-u.jp/files/56/ice.pdf)
- [Bread foam](https://ocw.nagoya-u.jp/files/56/bread.pdf)

Note: All files are in Japanese.

### Course Aims

Science and technology which human beings made, and living things and earth which nature created. We look into these common and different features and compare the features with each other. A topic will be decided by each group of the seminar participants. Students are going to learn the sensitivity to look into things and communication skill through the activities in this class: choosing a topic in a small group, doing a research on the topic which the group decided, making a presentation of the result and having a discussion of the presentation.

### Demands for members of this class

Students who attend class enthusiastically.

### Textbooks

No textbooks are required.

### References
