Instead, students are taught to have conceptual understandings before learning practical operation skills, so that they will be able to solve their problems by themselves using future versions of application software and operating systems.

Higher priority is given to lectures and lessons that is difficult to learn individually such as giving good presentations in front of audience with presentation tools.

Students are expected to be able to troubleshoot system problem by learning and understanding mechanism, system and network structure, and network layers.
