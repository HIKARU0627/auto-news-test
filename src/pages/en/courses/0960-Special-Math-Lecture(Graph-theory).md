### Goals of the Course
【Standardized across all programs】 In a global and interconnected society, mathematics play a central role. They are at the root of all communications tools, and serve as a universal language for natural and social sciences. All current technological developments are based on them. Mathematics can also be learned, enjoyed, and shared by everybody. Studying mathematics is also learning humility, tolerance, and diversity.

The aim of these Special Mathematics Lectures is to provide a solid knowledge on various mathematical topics. Concomitantly, students will develop a rigorous argumentation and a critical thinking. Each semester, a new subject is proposed, and these lectures are accessible to all students of Nagoya University, independently of their major and of their academic age. These special lectures also offer a unique opportunity to study in an international, transdisciplinary, and friendly environment. 


### Objectives of the Course

Graphs are playing an essential role in many fields, as for example in computer science, in optimization and in algorithmic complexity. Studying the abstract theory of graphs provides the tools for dealing with very diverse questions and with numerous applications.
During this course we shall study the abstract theory of finite graphs, and see extensions to infinite graphs. Various applications will be considered, and further developed according to the interest and to the motivation of the students. 

### Course Contents or Plan

1) The basics
2) Representations and structures
3) Trees
4) Spanning trees
5) Connectivity
6) Optimal traversals
7) Graph colorings
8) Directed graphs
9) Flows
10) Random graphs: the G(n;p) model
11) The configuration model
12) Epidemics on graphs

### Course Prerequisites and Related Courses
Basic knowledge on calculus and linear algebra, as provided in Calculus I & II and in Linear algebra I & II. Motivated 1st year students can also attend without these prerequisites but after a discussion with the instructor.


### Course Evaluation Method and Criteria
The final grade will be based on the active participation during the lectures and on some written reports. Students will be encouraged to work on applications related to their major during the semester. Students need to notify the course withdrawal to the instructor when they have no intention of finishing the course during the semester.


### Study Load (Self-directed Learning Outside Course Hours)
Students are expected to read their notes, and to be familiar with the content of the previous lectures before each new lecture. 

### Notice for students
It is expected that the students will show a certain maturity in studying independently and in choosing some exercises and problems to solve. Study sessions will be organized on a weekly basis.
