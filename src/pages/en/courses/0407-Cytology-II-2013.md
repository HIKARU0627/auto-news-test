### Course Aims

Living creatures are made up of the dynamic actions of independent cell clusters. This class will outline the specific traits of different types of cells that make up living creatures. This class is not designed to simply cram you full of facts. By introducing how cells inherent traits came to light historically, this class hopes to foster a sense of how interesting scientific research can be.

The first half of this class (led by Professor Kamikouchi) will focus on animals' nervous systems as an example of complex networks made up of cell groups. We will think how each individual cell's action leads to sensory processing and animal actions by learning about research using small-scale brains and nervous systems (especially Drosophila, the fruit-fly) as model organisms.

The second half of this class (led by Professor Kito) will introduce the general traits and functions of cells other than nerve cells. Through the class described above, students will deepen their understanding of the diversity and common traits in "cells" that make up organisms.

### Key Features

Incorporating cutting edge research not printed in textbooks yet, this class will explain fundamental knowledge relating neural network responsible for various vital functions, experimental methods, etc. At the end of the course students will be able to understand systematically the background of research on various life functions, including historical and chronological worldwide research trends, and what discoveries have been made based on the latest research.

### Course Schedule

First half

1. Small-scale model organisms supporting research on the brain and nervous system
2. Cellular basis of sensory reception
3. Neural network in brain responsible for processing sensory information
4. Neural network controlling behavior

Second half

1. Cell wall of bacteria Bacterial cell walls
2. Biological activity in components of cell wall components
3. Structure and biosynthesis of plant cell wall
4. Changes in cell wall structure accompanying ed by plant cell growth of plant cell

### Textbook

Taiz, Lincoln and Zeiger, Eduardo. Plant Physiology.
