## Faculty Introduction

### Guide to the School of Engineering

"Engineering" is a comprehensive academic field which develops science into technologies useful for people and society. Its subjects are wide, including chemicals, materials, electricity, machinery, energy, architecture, civil engineering and so on. Since the Industrial Revolution, mechanization has largely advanced, manufacturing has undergone tremendous progress, and along with that the lives of people have changed drastically. Recently, the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence may change greatly people's lives and social structure in near future. Meanwhile, issues such as global environment, mass consumption and exhaustion of fossil fuels and resources are also being closed up to the present. The scope of engineering covers not only conventional fields but also environment, disaster prevention, medical, drug discovery, and energy have been spreading widely. Under such circumstances, I hope that you contribute from "engineering" field to realize a sustainable society. Learn "engineering" with us at Nagoya University, challenge and overcome difficulties, and contribute to humanity and society as "courageous intellectuals (Yuki-Aru-Chishikijin)" in the engineering field.

## Message from the Dean

We asked 5 questions to Dean Makoto Kobashi.

**1. Would you mind telling the strengths of the School of Engineering / the Graduate School of Engineering?**

One of the strengths of the School of Engineering is its very wide range of future career options. Many students in the School of Engineering choose the Graduate School of Engineering for their postgraduate studies, but there are also some students going on to the Graduate School of Environmental Studies, and the Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences. This wide range of future career options is one of our strengths. 

One of the most exciting aspects of the Graduate School of Engineering is the opportunity to study in state-of-the-art research facilities. The Graduate School of Engineering has many relevant laboratories, research centers and facilities. We collaborate with world-class, cutting-edge research organizations in areas such as semiconductors, new materials, plasma, quantum and electron microscopy. Therefore, postgraduate students can devote deeply themselves to research in such an excellent environment. There is great potential to produce world-first research results.

**2. How do you want your students to grow through their university life?**

First of all, it is very important to learn basic academic knowledge. In addition, challenge yourself to do various things. Even if you fail, I hope you will learn lessons from your failures. I hope that students will study abroad, do a real internship, start a business, interact with diverse people, exercise, and do something different from others to develop a rich sensibility and become resilient. 

**3. Would you mind telling the vision of the School of Engineering / the Graduate School of Engineering?**

The School of Engineering and Graduate School of Engineering conduct a great deal of research that will lead to create a better future society. Therefore, it is necessary to maintain and develop our high research capabilities. We must also actively promote collaboration with universities and research institutes outside of Japan. 

And most importantly, we must educate human resources who will be active in various fields of engineering and other fields. To this end, we believe it is important to practice education that fosters correct knowledge and the wisdom that enables flexible application of that knowledge. 

**4. What is the most memorable lecture when you were a student?**

I studied metallic materials at Nagoya University. At that time, it was the so-called "Showa era," and I had the impression that there were many fearful professors. What left an impression on me was the experiment class. We were lively and practical in groups, melting and grinding metals, measuring their strength, and so on. Although the classrooms and laboratories were not air-conditioned at the time, I enjoyed the experiments such as melting metals by heating them. 

**5. Please give some words to those who are interested in joining.**

I would like you to place importance on "having a purpose" and "having curiosity. 

Having a purpose" means that when you do something, you should have a clear image of why you are doing it and what will make you happy by doing it. Research in the School of Engineering also has the goal of improving society. The School of Engineering has a purpose of objective of creating a better society of the future. I hope that as many students as possible will find it rewarding and apply to the School of Engineering because of its appeal. 

Having "curiosity" is very important when conducting research. Curiosity comes naturally when you work on what you like. For this reason, it is a good idea to think about what you like or what you might be passionate about, even if only vaguely. It is wonderful to be able to research what you love and to be able to immerse yourself in it. I would like many students to experience this.
