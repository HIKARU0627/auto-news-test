### International Education & Exchange Center

Nagatoshi Nagahata, Ph.D  
Director, International Education & Exchange Center  
Vice Dean and Professor, Graduate School of Humanities

The International Education & Exchange Center (IEEC) to Nagoya
University was established in October 2013 after the former Education
Center for International Students having been restructured and
enlarged. As the other institute belonging to the administrative office
for international education and exchange, the International Language
Center was established at the same time, which is to take in charge
education of Japanese and other languages.

The principal mission of the IEEC is to give general support to the
international activities, which college students are expected to
perform. The center is composed of four sections: department of
international program, department of international education &
exchange, department of advising & counseling services and NU
abroad. These units greatly contribute, with mutual understanding
and appropriate cooperation, to the effectual international activities
of our university in such fields as accepting international students,
providing them with supports for their studies, daily lives, job hunting.
Sending Japanese students to foreign universities is also what the
center takes charge of.

In September 2016, Nagoya University was accepted as a member of
the Top Global University project promoted by the government and is
now trying to make, as one of the major universities to carry out
distinguished education and research at a worldwide level, further
progress of internationalization. Academic performances in
universities essentially having a universal character, it is natural for
as many results as possible of international exchanges to be made
profit of. And it is human entities like university staff and students
that take in charge not only of academic activities but also of their
applications. Therefore, without these human subjects performing
international activities, no true internationalization of any university is
to be expected.

In fact, Japan has succeeded in attaining originality and refinement in
her culture by sending students to and accepting sophisticated
human resources from China where highly developed civilization
prospered. The Renaissance period in Europe saw humanists like
Erasmus went to various parts to make discussions with other
scholars using Latin, the universal tool for communication at that
time. Such international activities enabled the European world to
reactivate liberal academic researches, which had fallen into
stagnation during the middle age.

Thus, by accepting different cultures and languages as well as by
sending people and information to other parts of the world, human
beings are allowed to develop even higher civilization than otherwise.
Nagoya University has been making great contributions both to
education and to academic research in the world, but still greater
contributions than have ever been made will become possible by our
strenuous efforts to realize further internationalization. I believe that
the IEEC will be of great help to enhance international activities by
Nagoya University.
