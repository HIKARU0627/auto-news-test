## Faculty Introduction

### Teaching at the School of Medicine

Nagoya University's School of Medicine, as well as being one of the country's oldest medical faculties with its roots in the Owari-han school, and able to boast over 13,600 graduates over 130 years, also operates as a focal point of medical treatment and care dedicated to supporting 21st century Japan. Its activities can be broadly detailed into four categories, which are:

Leading medical research to contribute to humanity and the development of medical technology
Training talented doctors who respect the ethics of medicine and contribute to the well-being of humanity
Advancing the medical treatment of our regional community, our country and our world community
Constructing open systems for medical centres and research
We hope to attract young ladies and gentlemen who can work with a strong sense of duty to contribute to society through medicine with an international outlook.

### Rich and Practical Knowledge of Humanity – Towards New Medicine and Medical Care –

Our important mission is to train capable people who can pioneer the healthcare and medicine of tomorrow with an international outlook, while also safely advancing Japanese healthcare. Our teaching in particular aims to foster the importance of self-reliance alongside a feeling of internationalism. With our department's teaching of medicine, we highlight the importance of student autonomy. Therefore, we give students a half year course of personal research in 3rd grade, and the results of which are presented in international academic conferences and English journals. In the following six years we select students with a high level of English ability and give them personal experience of clinical practice at top notch universities such as Harvard, Johns Hopkins, Duke, Vienna, and Freiburg, encouraging international sentiment. Furthermore, after graduating we continue to train doctors with a high level of clinical ability by sponsoring further postgraduate training at associated top-level Japanese hospitals, while respecting the students' intentions.
