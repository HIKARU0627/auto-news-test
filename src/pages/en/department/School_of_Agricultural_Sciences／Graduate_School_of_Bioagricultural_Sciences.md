## Faculty Introduction

Agricultural sciences contribute to solve the current issues on production and sustainability of food, environmental preservation, life-long health, and development of biomass energy through making clear and enhancing the function and mechanism of a living thing in the range from molecular level up to ecosystem. At the same time, the scope of the research is expanding toward a new horizon by constructing the research network with relevant or different disciplines.

Challenging these complicated and diverse issues, we nurture the students who have the potential accepted in the international field, acquiring with logical consideration and creativity based on the knowledge of agriculture and life sciences and abilities putting it into practice.

The School of Agricultural Sciences celebrated its 60th anniversary in 2011. The School has been engaged in the pursuit of education and research in the biological, biochemical, molecular biological and environmental sciences, which provide the foundation for agricultural and bio-industrial advancement. Currently, the undergraduate course consists of three departments: Department of Bioenvironmental Sciences, Department of Bioresource Sciences, and Department of Applied Biosciences.

The Graduate School has restructured its organization, the original seven departments to four, more comprehensive ones in 1997, in order to put more emphasis on advanced research and to develop human resources with high-level specialized knowledge, techniques and critical thinking. The renovated Graduate School, the Graduate School of Bioagricultural Sciences, has established a new, interdisciplinary system to provide a more comprehensive insight into diverse overlapping sciences and technologies. We make efforts to promote the quality of education and to advance research in bioresource production, biological environment, biological signals and advanced biotechnology based on a comprehensive understanding of life processes at the levels of the molecule, cell individual, community, and environment. Currently, incoming graduate students can join one of four graduate programs: Biosphere Resources Science, Biological Mechanisms and Functions, Applied Molecular Biosciences, and Bioengineering Sciences.
