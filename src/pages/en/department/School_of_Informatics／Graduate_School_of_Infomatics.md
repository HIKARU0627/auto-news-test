### Concept

The information revolution which has begun in the second half of the 20th century, not only gave new solutions to complex and difficult tasks mankind faced, but also provided a measure for creating new value. Furthermore, in the 21st century, it is possible to acquire enormous amounts of information (big data) from nature, humanity, society, artifacts and directly process that data to obtain valuable findings; something that human beings could not have imagined previously. On the other hand, it can be said that the Information Revolution has had a negative affect on mankind and has made finding solutions to problems more complicated. Needless to say, the problems which mankind faces are created by the entanglement of nature, humanity, society and artifacts, and solving these problems will take a multidisciplinary approach. Big data has created complex problems that will require robust data processing tools to adequately deal with the issues.

In order for mankind to address these complex problems and create new value from the information revolution, it is necessary to extend the information sciences themselves with the ultimate goal of creating a new “information science”. Based on the above statements, our urgent task is to nurture researchers who can develop new horizons and build new informatics, or to foster researchers of each eld, who can easily cope with the barriers existing between liberal arts and sciences and have backgrounds related to the informatics. In addition, it is vital to foster intellectuals who can take on complicated problems by making use of informatics, in various scenes of the informationized world. Realizing that it is an important social mission to respond to such human resource training, we established the School of Informatics and the Graduate School of Informatics.

The School of Informatics cultivates the basic knowledge and applicability of information science and technology and the ability to universally understand nature and society as a system, and fosters intellectuals who can solve the challenges which mankind faces by creating value through innovative system research and design. In addition, we take “information” from various perspectives such as natural sciences, humanities and social sciences, engineering, mathematical science, computer science, media science, data science, complex science, human science, life science, and so on, and systematize “information” with the aim of developing a new integrated eld for informatics.

The Graduate School of Informatics utilizes innovative information science technologies to universally understanding of nature and society as a system in order to solve the problems mankind faces. This comprehensive approach creates new value through informatics and promotes its research. Furthermore, based on a deep understanding of informatics, we foster intellectuals who can contribute to the innovation of the information science and technology eld; professionals who can contribute to the innovation of information science and technology, the structure of manufacturing based on information science technology, the structure of society and organization, the methods of decision making, the methods of scientfic research, etc. We also provide new value to humans and society through human resource development.
