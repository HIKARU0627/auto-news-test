### 授業の目的

As a basic subject, by taking this course, participants are expected to understand the outline of law and institution in the context of development, as well as how to implement legal regulations for the development.  
Through this course, students should understand: what is the relationship between the legal system and socio-economic-politicaldevelopment; what legal system is desirable for socio-economic development; what is the mechanism of legal development; what is adifference of legal system and practice between developing society and developed society.  
In the first part of the lecture, the lecture will discuss theoretical aspects of the law and development, including economic theory, legaltheory, and cultural theory. The focus of this course is not limited to the law in narrow definitions such as legislation, regulation, orjudgment. The discussion also covers various forms of government mechanisms, public administration, and political regimes. Furthermore,informal law (such as religious or customary norms and institutions) has a significant impact on development. Thus, the course alsodiscusses the relationship between development and informal institutions.

In the second part, this lecture will try conducting practical lessons, namely, learning legislation. In implementing a development project,legislation plays a significant role by changing peoples behavior (imposing sanctions), legitimating resource allocation (e.g., allowing agovernment to allocate budget to a particular area), giving guidelines (showing what is an expected goal), or maintaining social order (solvingdisputes in a peaceful way).  
In this lecture, we will make a draft bill to achieve a development goal (the issue will be discussed in the class). Legal drafting includes goalsetting, making legal research on facts, determining ways of the regulation (punishment or incentive), constructing a consistent structureof rules, and so on. Students are expected to participate actively in the class and preparation work.
