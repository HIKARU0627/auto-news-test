### 授業の内容

This course covers basic legal frameworks and advanced issues concerning the protection of intellectual property (IP) (e.g., patents, trademarks, copyrights). Main focus will be put on Japanese law and international treaties (such as the Paris and Berne Conventions, and the TRIPS Agreement), but laws of other major countries, particularly the US and the EU, will be also touched on.

Professor Nishii will teach the first four classes, and then Professor Suzuki will teach the rest of the classes.

### 授業の工夫

日常生活の中で見聞きしたはずの事件や現象を挙げ、それらと法制度の関係を説明することによって、授業の内容に入り込みやすくなるようにしています。また、なるべく図表を活用することにより、視覚を通じた理解の促進を図るように心がけています。

### 授業の目標

This course aims at introducing students who have not studied IP law before to the basics of IP law. The course will also deal with advanced issues in IP law so that students who are familiar with this area of law would also find it interesting and useful.
